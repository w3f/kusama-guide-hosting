In order for the state of the
blockchain to continue to build and move forward, all nodes in the network must agree and come to
consensus. It is the way that the nodes in a decentralized network are able to stay synced with each
other. Without consensus for the decentralized network of nodes in a blockchain, there is no way to
ensure that the state one node believes is true will be shared by the other nodes. Consensus aims to
provide the <em>objective</em> view of the state amid participants who each have their own <em>subjective</em>
views of the network. It is the process by which these nodes communicate and come to agreement, and
are able to build new blocks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-pow-and-pos">What are PoW and PoS?<a href="#what-are-pow-and-pos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are PoW and PoS?" title="Direct link to What are PoW and PoS?">â€‹</a></h2><p>Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) have been inaccurately used as short hand to refer to
consensus mechanisms of blockchains, but that does not capture the full picture. PoW is the method
for agreeing on a block author and part of the fuller <a href="#nakamoto-consensus">Nakamoto consensus</a> that
also encompasses a chain selection algorithm (longest chain rule in Bitcoin). Similarly, PoS is a
set of rules for selecting the validator set and does not specify a chain selection rule or how a
chain might reach finality. PoS algorithms have traditionally been paired with an algorithm for
coming to Byzantine agreement between nodes. For example, <a href="/docs/learn-comparisons-cosmos">Tendermint</a>
is a practical Byzantine fault tolerant algorithm that uses PoS as its validator set selection
method.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-not-proof-of-work">Why not Proof of Work?<a href="#why-not-proof-of-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why not Proof of Work?" title="Direct link to Why not Proof of Work?">â€‹</a></h2><p>Although simple and effective in coming to a decentralized consensus on the next block producer,
proof of work with Nakamoto consensus consumes an incredible amount of energy, has no economic or
provable finality, and has no effective strategy in resisting cartels.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nominated-proof-of-stake">Nominated Proof of Stake<a href="#nominated-proof-of-stake" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Nominated Proof of Stake" title="Direct link to Nominated Proof of Stake">â€‹</a></h2><p>In traditional PoS systems, block production participation is dependent on token holdings as opposed
to computational power. While PoS developers usually have a proponent for equitable participation in
a decentralized manner, most projects end up proposing some level of centralized operation, where
the number of validators with full participation rights is limited. These validators are often seen
to be the most wealthy, and, as a result, influence the PoS network as they are the most staked.
Usually, the number of candidates to maintain the network with the necessary knowledge (and
equipment) is limited; this can directly increase operational costs as well. Systems with a large
number of validators tend to form pools to decrease the variance of their revenue and profit from
economies of scale. These pools are often off-chain.</p><p>A way to alleviate this is to implement pool formation on-chain and allow token holders to vote with
their stake for validators to represent them.</p><p>Kusama uses NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake)
as its mechanism for selecting the validator set. It is designed with the roles of <strong>validators</strong>
and <strong>nominators</strong>, to maximize chain security. Actors who are interested in maintaining the network
can run a validator node.</p><p>Validators assume the role of producing new blocks in <a href="#block-production-babe">BABE</a>, validating
parachain blocks, and guaranteeing finality. Nominators can choose to back select validators with
their stake. Nominators can approve candidates that they trust and back them with their tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="probabilistic-vs-provable-finality">Probabilistic vs. Provable Finality<a href="#probabilistic-vs-provable-finality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Probabilistic vs. Provable Finality" title="Direct link to Probabilistic vs. Provable Finality">â€‹</a></h2><p>A pure Nakamoto consensus blockchain that runs PoW is only able to achieve the notion of
<em>probabilistic finality</em> and reach <em>eventual consensus</em>. Probabilistic finality means that under
some assumptions about the network and participants, if we see a few blocks building on a given
block, we can estimate the probability that it is final. Eventual consensus means that at some point
in the future, all nodes will agree on the truthfulness of one set of data. This eventual consensus
may take a long time and will not be able to be determined how long it will take ahead of time.
However, finality gadgets such as GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement)
or Ethereum&#x27;s Casper FFG (the Friendly Finality Gadget) are designed to give stronger and quicker
guarantees on the finality of blocks - specifically, that they can never be reverted after some
process of Byzantine agreements has taken place. The notion of irreversible consensus is known as
<em>provable finality.</em></p><p>In the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRANDPA paper</a>, it is phrased
in this way:</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>We say an oracle A in a protocol is <em>eventually consistent</em> if it returns the same value to all

Kusama, GRANDPA and BABE (Blind Assignment
for Blockchain Extension). We talk about both of these because
Kusama uses what is known as <em>hybrid
consensus</em>. Hybrid consensus splits up the finality gadget from the block production mechanism.</p><p>This is a way of getting the benefits of probabilistic finality (the ability to always produce new
blocks) and provable finality (having a universal agreement on the canonical chain with no chance
for reversion) in Kusama. It also avoids the
corresponding drawbacks of each mechanism (the chance of unknowingly following the wrong fork in
probabilistic finality, and a chance for &quot;stalling&quot; - not being able to produce new blocks - in
provable finality). By combining these two mechanisms,
Kusama allows for blocks to be rapidly
produced, and the slower finality mechanism to run in a separate process to finalize blocks without
risking slower transaction processing or stalling.</p><p>Hybrid consensus has been proposed in the past. Notably, it was proposed (now defunct) as a step in
Ethereum&#x27;s transition to proof of stake in <a href="http://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EIP 1011</a>, which
specified <a href="#casper-ffg">Casper FFG</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="block-production-babe">Block Production: BABE<a href="#block-production-babe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Block Production: BABE" title="Direct link to Block Production: BABE">â€‹</a></h2><p>BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension) is the block production mechanism that runs between
the validator nodes and determines the authors of new blocks. BABE is comparable as an algorithm to
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ouroboros Praos</a>, with some key differences in chain
selection rule and slot time adjustments. BABE assigns block production slots to validators
according to stake and using the Kusama
<a href="/docs/learn-cryptography#randomness">randomness cycle</a>. The chains runtime is required to provide
the BABE authority list and randomness to the host via a consensus message in the header of the
first block of each epoch.</p><p>BABE execution happens in sequential non-overlapping phases known as epochs. Each epoch is divided
into a predefined number of slots. All slots in each epoch are sequentially indexed starting from 0
(slot number). At the beginning of each epoch, the BABE node needs to run the
<a href="https://spec.polkadot.network/#algo-block-production-lottery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Block-Production-Lottery algorithm</a>
to find out in which slots it should produce a block and gossip to the other block producers.</p><p>Validators participate in a lottery for every slot, which will inform whether or not they are the
block producer candidate for that slot. Slots are discrete units of time of approximately 6 seconds
in length. Because the mechanism of allocating slots to validators is based on a randomized design,
multiple validators could be candidates for the same slot. Other times, a slot could be empty,
resulting in inconsistent block time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multiple-validators-per-slot">Multiple Validators per Slot<a href="#multiple-validators-per-slot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multiple Validators per Slot" title="Direct link to Multiple Validators per Slot">â€‹</a></h3><p>When multiple validators are block producer candidates in a given slot, all will produce a block and
broadcast it to the network. At that point, it&#x27;s a race. The validator whose block reaches most of
the network first wins. Depending on network topology and latency, both chains will continue to
build in some capacity, until finalization kicks in and amputates a fork. See Fork Choice below for
how that works.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-validators-in-slot">No Validators in Slot<a href="#no-validators-in-slot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to No Validators in Slot" title="Direct link to No Validators in Slot">â€‹</a></h3><p>When no validators have rolled low enough in the randomness lottery to qualify for block production,
a slot can remain seemingly blockless. We avoid this by running a secondary, round-robin style
validator selection algorithm in the background. The validators selected to produce blocks through
this algorithm always produce blocks, but these <em>secondary</em> blocks are ignored if the same slot also
produces a primary block from a <a href="/docs/learn-cryptography#randomness">VRF-selected</a> validator. Thus,
a slot can have either a <em>primary</em> or a <em>secondary</em> block, and no slots are ever skipped.</p><p>For more details on BABE, please see the

implemented for the Kusama Relay Chain.</p><p>The Kusama Host uses the GRANDPA Finality
protocol to finalize blocks. Finality is obtained by consecutive rounds of voting by the validator
nodes. Validators execute GRANDPA finality process in parallel to Block Production as an independent
service.</p><p>It works in a partially synchronous network model as long as 2/3 of nodes are honest and can cope
with 1/5 Byzantine nodes in an asynchronous setting.</p><p>A notable distinction is that GRANDPA reaches agreements on chains rather than blocks, greatly
speeding up the finalization process, even after long-term network partitioning or other networking
failures.</p><p>In other words, as soon as more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block,
all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="protocol">Protocol<a href="#protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Protocol" title="Direct link to Protocol">â€‹</a></h3><p>Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GRANDPA paper</a>

support efficient bridging between the
Kusama network (relay chain) and remote,
segregated blockchains, such as Ethereum, which were not built with the
Kusama interchain operability in mind. The
protocol allows participants of the remote network to verify finality proofs created by the
Kusama relay chain validators. In other
words: clients in the Ethereum network should able to verify that the
Kusama network is at a specific state.</p><p>Storing all the information necessary to verify the state of the remote chain, such as the block
headers, is too expensive. BEEFY stores the information in a space-efficient way and clients can
request additional information over the protocol.</p><p>For additional implementation details, check out

Kusama becomes clear. BABE must always build
on the chain that has been finalized by GRANDPA. When there are forks after the finalized head, BABE
provides probabilistic finality by building on the chain with the most primary blocks.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Best chain choice" src="/assets/images/best_chain-52a3da00fb2f804a198c73690fcedc4f.png" width="1739" height="817" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the above image, the black blocks are finalized, and the yellow blocks are not. Blocks marked
with a &quot;1&quot; are primary blocks; those marked with a &quot;2&quot; are secondary blocks. Even though the topmost

primaries at the time of evaluation than the one below it.</p><h1>Comparisons</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nakamoto-consensus">Nakamoto consensus<a href="#nakamoto-consensus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Nakamoto consensus" title="Direct link to Nakamoto consensus">â€‹</a></h2><p>Nakamoto consensus consists of the longest chain rule using proof of work as its Sybil resistance
mechanism and leader election.</p><p>Nakamoto consensus only gives us probabilistic finality. Probabilistic finality states that a block
in the past is only as safe as the number of confirmations it has, or the number of blocks that have
been built on top of it. As more blocks are built on top of a specific block in a Proof of Work
chain, more computational work has been expended behind this particular chain. However, it does not
guarantee that the chain containing the block will always remain the agreed-upon chain, since an
actor with unlimited resources could potentially build a competing chain and expend enough
computational resources to create a chain that did not contain a specific block. In such a
situation, the longest chain rule employed in Bitcoin and other proof of work chains would move to
this new chain as the canonical one.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pbft--tendermint">PBFT / Tendermint<a href="#pbft--tendermint" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PBFT / Tendermint" title="Direct link to PBFT / Tendermint">â€‹</a></h2><p>Please see the <a href="/docs/learn-comparisons-cosmos#consensus">relevant section</a> in the Cosmos comparison
