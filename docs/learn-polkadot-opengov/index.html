the bonded tokens in the pool, as they are held in a
<a href="/docs/learn-account-advanced#system-accounts">system account</a>.</strong></p></div></div><p>Kusama uses a sophisticated governance
mechanism that allows it to evolve gracefully overtime at the ultimate behest of its assembled
stakeholders. The stated goal is to ensure that the majority of the stake can always command the
network.</p><p>Kusama brings together various novel
mechanisms, including an amorphous (abstract) form of state-transition function stored on-chain
defined in a platform-agnostic language (i.e. <a href="/docs/learn-wasm">WebAssembly</a>), and several on-chain
voting mechanisms such as referenda and batch approval voting. All changes to the protocol must be
agreed upon by stake-weighted referenda.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="premise">Premise<a href="#premise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Premise" title="Direct link to Premise">​</a></h2><p>Kusama&#x27;s first governance system
(<a href="/docs/learn-governance">Governance V1</a>) included three main components.</p><ul><li>The <a href="/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee">Technical Committee</a>: A technocratic committee to
manage upgrade timelines.</li><li>The <a href="/docs/learn-governance#council">Council</a>: An approval-voted, elected executive &quot;government&quot; to
manage parameters, admin, and spending proposals.</li><li>The Public: All token holders.</li></ul><p>Over the first few years of operation, Governance V1 ensured the appropriate usage of treasury funds
and enabled timely upgrades and fixes. Like most early technologies, protocols must evolve as they
mature to improve their shortcomings and keep up with modern advancements. In Governance V1, all
referenda carried the same weight as only one referendum could be voted on at a time (except for
emergency proposals), and the voting period could last multiple weeks. Also, an
<a href="/docs/learn-governance#alternating-voting-timetable">alternating voting timetable</a> allowed to vote
either for a public referendum or a council motion every
7 days. This resulted in the system favoring
careful consideration of very few proposals instead of broad consideration of many.</p><p>Polkadot OpenGov changes how the practical means of day-to-day decisions are made, making the
repercussions of referenda better scoped and agile to increase the number of collective decisions
the system can make at any given time.</p><p>The following content is focused on what the new Polkadot OpenGov version brings to the governance
on Kusama, and on the main differences with
previous governance versions. We recommend learning about <a href="/docs/learn-governance">Governance v1</a> to
better understand the need for and the direction of Polkadot OpenGov.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>In Governance v1, active token holders (public) and the Council together administrated network&#x27;s
upgrade decisions. Whether the public or the council initiated the proposal, it would eventually
have to go through a referendum to let all holders (weighted by stake and conviction) make the
decision.</p><p>The Council fulfilled its role as the representative of the public, guardian of the treasury and
initiator of legislation, but it was often seen as a centralized entity. To further decentralize
Kusama, Polkadot OpenGov proposes the
following main changes:</p><ul><li>Migrating all responsibilities of the Council to the public via a direct democracy voting system.</li><li>Dissolving the current <a href="/docs/learn-governance#council">Council</a> collective</li><li>Allowing users to delegate voting power in more ways to community members</li><li>Dissolving the <a href="/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee">Technical Committee</a> and establishing
the broader <a href="#the-technical-fellowship">Polkadot Technical Fellowship</a></li></ul><p>The figure below shows an overview of Polkadot OpenGov&#x27;s structure.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>See <a href="/docs/learn-governance#summary">this page</a> for a comparison with the structure of Governance V1.</p></div></div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="opengov-overview" src="/assets/images/opengov-overview-a56ef29a3a173f9dc2b60a9008dcfc1b.png" width="1920" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In Polkadot OpenGov, all the proposals are initiated by the public. The proposal will enter a
Lead-in period (for more information, see <a href="#referenda-timeline">Referenda Timeline</a>), after which it
will follow a specific <a href="#origins-and-tracks">Track</a> which has a dedicated Origin. There are
<a href="/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#origins-and-tracks-info">15 Origins</a>, each with a different
track. The origins and tracks parameters are preset values that set the duration of a referendum as
well as how many referenda can be voted on simultaneously. For example, a treasury proposal can now
be submitted in different tracks depending on the amount requested. A proposal for a small tip will
need to be submitted in the Small Tipper track, while a proposal requiring substantial funds will
need to be submitted to the Medium or Big Spender track.</p><p>The <a href="#the-technical-fellowship">Polkadot Technical Fellowship</a> can decide to
<a href="#whitelisting">whitelist</a> a proposal that will be enacted through the Whitelist Caller origin.
Those proposals will have a shorter Lead-in, Confirmation, and Enactment period when compared to the
Root Origin track.</p><p>Each track has its own preset <a href="#approval-and-support">Approval and Support</a> curves which are based
on the origin&#x27;s privileges. When both the approval and support criteria are satisfied for a specific
period (called the confirmation period), the referenda passes and will be executed after the
enactment period.</p><p>All referenda within each track and across tracks can be voted on simultaneously (assuming track
maximum capacity is not reached).</p><p>Polkadot OpenGov also comes with multi-role delegations where the token holder can assign voting
power on different tracks to different entities who are experts in judging the referenda submitted
to those tracks. For example, suppose a token holder does not have the technical background to
consider the merits and vote on the referenda submitted to the Root track. In that case, they can
delegate their voting power just for the Root track to a trusted expert who (according to them) acts
in the best interest of the network protocol. In this way, token holders do not need to be
up-to-date with governance matters and can still make their votes count through delegates.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Delegation Dashboard</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>To easily delegate your votes you can use the

However,
it is not immediately in a state where it can end or otherwise have its votes counted, be approved,
and ultimately enacted. Instead, the proposal will stay within a <strong>Lead-in Period</strong> until it
fulfills three criteria:</p><ul><li>Proposals must stay within the lead-in period for a pre-defined minimum amount of time. This helps
mitigate against the possibility of &quot;decision sniping&quot; where an attacker controlling a substantial
amount of voting power might seek to have a proposal passed immediately after proposing, not
allowing the overall voting population adequate time to consider and participate.</li><li>There must be enough room for the decision within the origin. Different origins have their limit
on the number of proposals that can be decided simultaneously. Tracks that have more potent
abilities will have lower limits. For example, the Root level Origin has a limit of one, implying
that only a single proposal may be decided on at once.</li><li>A decision deposit must be submitted. Creating a referendum is cheap as the deposit value consists
of only the value required for the on-chain storage needed to track it. But, having a referendum
reviewed and decided upon carries the risk of using up the limited spots available in the
referenda queue. Having a more significant but refundable deposit requirement makes sense to help
mitigate spam. Failing to submit the decision deposit will lead to a referendum <em>timeout</em>.</li></ul><p>Until they are in the lead-in period, proposals remain undecided. Once the criteria above are met,
the referendum moves to the <em>deciding</em> state. The votes of the referendum are now counted towards
the outcome.</p><p>In (2), the proposal enters the <strong>Decision Period</strong> where votes can be cast. For a proposal to be
approved, votes must satisfy the approval and support criteria for at least the <strong>Confirmation
Period</strong>; otherwise, the proposal is automatically rejected. A rejected proposal can be resubmitted
anytime and as many times as needed.</p><p>In (3), approved proposals will enter the <strong>Enactment Period</strong>, after which proposed changes will be
executed.</p><p>Note how the length of the lead-in, decision, confirmation, and enactment periods vary depending on
the origin. Root origin has more extended periods than the other origins. Also, the number of
referenda within each track differs, with the Root origin track only accepting one. proposal at a
time (see below).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="opengov-track-capacity" src="/assets/images/opengov-track-capacity-a1e00e5bd7961ea13d38f79cf6fa4b9c.png" width="1920" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This directly affects the number of proposals that can be voted on and executed simultaneously.
Continuing the comparison between Root and Small Tipper, Small Tipper will allow many proposals on
its track to be executed simultaneously. In contrast, Root will allow only one proposal in its
track. Once the track capacity is filled, additional proposals in the lead-in period will queue
until place is available to enter the decision period.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="origins-and-tracks">Origins and Tracks<a href="#origins-and-tracks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Origins and Tracks" title="Direct link to Origins and Tracks">​</a></h3><p>An <strong>Origin</strong> is a specific level of privilege that will determine the <strong>Track</strong> of all referenda
executed with that origin. The track is basically a pipeline in which the proposal lives and
proceeds and is independent from other origins&#x27; tracks. The proposer of the referenda now selects an
appropriate Origin for their request based on the proposal’s requirements.</p><p>Although the track structure is the same for all origins, track parameters are not. Such parameters
include:</p><ul><li><strong>Maximum Deciding or Capacity</strong>: the limit for the number of referenda that can be decided at
once (i.e. the number of tracks within each origin).</li><li><strong>Decision deposit</strong>: the amount of funds that must be placed on deposit to enter the Decision
Period (note that more requirements must be met to enter the Decision Period).</li><li><strong>Preparation Period</strong>: the minimum amount of voting time needed before entering the Decision
Period (given capacity and deposit are met).</li><li><strong>Decision Period</strong>: the maximum time to approve a proposal. The proposal will be accepted if
approved by the end of the period.</li><li><strong>Confirmation Period</strong>: the minimum amount of time (within the Decision Period) the approval and
support criteria must hold before the proposal is approved and moved to the enactment period.</li><li><strong>Minimum Enactment Period</strong>: the minimum amount of waiting time before the proposed changes are
applied</li><li><strong>Approval Curve</strong>: the curve describing the minimum % of <em>aye</em> votes as a function of time within
the Decision Period. The approval % is the portion of <em>aye</em> votes (adjusted for conviction) over
the total votes (<em>aye</em>, <em>nay</em>, and <em>abstained</em>).</li><li><strong>Support Curve</strong>: the curve describing the minimum % of all votes in support of a proposal as a
function of time within the Decision Period. The support % is defined as the portion of all votes
(<em>aye</em> and <em>abstained</em>) without conviction over the total possible amount of votes in the system
(i.e. the total active issuance).</li></ul><p>For example, a runtime upgrade (requiring a <code>set_code</code> call, if approved) does not have the same
implications for the ecosystem as the approval of a treasury tip (<code>reportAwesome</code> call), and
therefore different Origins for these two actions are needed in which different deposits, support,
approval, and a minimum <a href="#enactment">enactment</a> periods will be predetermined on the pallet.</p><p>For detailed information about origin and tracks, and parameter values in Kusama, see

abstained from it. Support does not include <em>nay</em> votes. This avoids edge situations where <em>nay</em>
votes could push a referendum into confirming state. For example, imagine current approval is high
(near 100%, way above the approval curve), and current support is just below the support curve. A
<em>nay</em> could bump support above the support curve but not reduce approval below the approval curve.
Therefore someone voting against a proposal would make it pass. Hence, a decrease in % of current
approval through new votes does not directly translate into increasing support because Support needs
to consider <em>nay</em> votes.</p></div></div><p>The figure above shows the followings:</p><ul><li>Even if the approval threshold is reached (i.e. % of current approval is greater than the approval
curve), the proposal only enters the confirmation period once the support threshold is also
reached (i.e. % current support is greater than the underlying support curve).</li><li>If the referendum meets the criteria for the confirmation period, then the proposal is approved
and scheduled for enactment. The Enactment Period can be specified when the referendum is proposed
but is also subject to a minimum value based on the Track. More powerful Tracks enforce a larger
Enactment Period to ensure the network has ample time to prepare for any changes the proposal may
bring.</li><li>A referendum may exit the confirmation period when the thresholds are no longer met, due to new
<em>Nay</em> votes or a change of existing <em>Aye</em> or <em>Abstain</em> votes to <em>Nay</em> . Each time it exits, the
confirmation period resets. For example, if the confirmation period is 20 minutes and a referendum
enters it just for 5 min, the next time it enters, it must stay for 20 minutes (not 15 minutes).</li><li>During the decision period, if a referendum fails to meet the approval and support thresholds for
the duration of the track-specific confirmation period, it fails and does not go to the enactment
period (it may have to be resubmitted, see below).</li><li>The current approval must be above 50% for a referendum to pass, and the approval curve never goes
below 50%.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="opengov-curves-pass" src="/assets/images/opengov-curves-nopass-27f6968907aeb88e87069d29ca062568.png" width="1920" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Note that support may not increase monotonically as shown in the figure, as people might switch
votes.</p><p>Different Origins&#x27; tracks have different Confirmation Periods and requirements for approval and
support. For additional details on the various origins and tracks, check out
<a href="/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#origins-and-tracks-info">this table</a>. Configuring the amount of
support and overall approval required for it to pass is now possible. With proposals that use less
privileged origins, it is far more reasonable to drop the required support to a more realistic
amount earlier than those which use highly privileged classes such as <code>Root</code>. Classes with more
significance can be made to require higher approval early on, to avoid controversy.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enactment">Enactment<a href="#enactment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enactment" title="Direct link to Enactment">​</a></h3><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Enactment in Governance v1</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>See <a href="/docs/learn-governance#enactment">this page</a> for more information about enactment in Governance

<a href="/docs/learn-governance#delegations">vote delegation feature from Governance v1</a> where a voter can
delegate their voting power to another voter. It does so by introducing a feature known as
<strong>multirole delegation</strong>, where voters can specify a different delegate for every class of
referendum in the system. Delegation can be done per track, and accounts can choose to select
different delegates (or no delegation) for each track.</p><p>For example, a voter could delegate one entity for managing a less potent referenda class, choose a
different delegate for another class with more powerful consequences and still retain full voting
power over any remaining classes.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Delegate your votes</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>In Polkadot OpenGov you can delegate your votes to different entities, who will vote on your behalf.
You can delegate your votes using the
<a href="https://delegation.polkadot.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Polkadot Delegation Dashboard</strong></a>. See
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RapBYZc5ZPo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video tutorial</a> to learn about the features of
the dashboard.</p><p>If you are staking directly and not through a nomination pool, you can use bonded tokens for voting.
Note that if you are voting with conviction, your tokens will have a democracy lock in addition to
the staking lock. For more information about locks, see
<a href="/docs/learn-accounts/#unlocking-locks">this page</a>.</p><p>Democracy locks created through <a href="#voluntary-locking">conviction voting</a> start the unlocking period
after a referendum ends, provided you voted with the winning side. In the case of delegations, the
unlocking period countdown begins after the account undelegates. There can be different scenarios:</p><ul><li>if the account delegated votes to one delegate, then after undelegating, there will be one
unlocking period with length dependent on the conviction multiplier.</li><li>if the account delegated votes to different delegates using different convictions, then after
undelegating those delegates, there will be different unlocking periods with lengths dependent on
the conviction multipliers.</li></ul></div></div><p>It is worth noting that a user delegating their voting power does not imply that the delegate will
have control over the funds of the delegating user&#x27;s account. That delegate&#x27;s account can vote with
a user&#x27;s voting power but won&#x27;t be able to transfer balances, nominate a different set of
validators, or execute any call other than voting on the tracks defined by the user.</p><p>The goal of delegations is to ensure the required support for proposals to be enacted is reached
while keeping the overall design censorship-free. Also, voters might not have the technical
knowledge to judge some referenda or might not have the time to read all referenda. Delegations
allow voters to participate in OpenGov hands-free by delegating their voting power to trusted
entities.</p><p>For a step-by-step outline of how to delegate voting power in Polkadot OpenGov, check out the

This fellowship was
established in 2022. In Polkadot OpenGov, this fellowship replaces the
<a href="/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee">Technical Committee</a> in Governance v1, and will serve
both the Polkadot and Kusama networks.</p><p>For more information about the Fellowship see the
<a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/0c3df46d76625980b8b48742cb86f4d8fa6dda8d/manifesto.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fellowship Manifesto</a>.</p></div></div><p>The Technical Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing
humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Kusama and/or Polkadot networks
and protocols. This is accomplished by associating a rank with members to categorize the degree to
which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis, and in line
with the interests of Polkadot and/or Kusama.</p><p>Unlike the Technical Committee in Governance V1, the Fellowship is designed to be far broader in
membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and with far lower barriers to
entry (both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise).</p><p>The mechanism by which the Fellowship votes is the same as what is used for Polkadot and Kusama
stakeholder voting for a proposed referendum. Members of the Fellowship can vote on any given
Fellowship proposal and the aggregated opinion of the members (weighted by their rank) constitutes
the Fellowship&#x27;s considered opinion.</p><p>The Polkadot Technical Fellowship resides on the
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship/referenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collectives</a>
parachain and maintains the <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot Fellows</a> repository. The
fellowship also has its own governance model with multiple tracks with approval and support
parameters, where the votes are weighted by the rank of the member.<br>
<!-- -->The fellowship governance is primarily used for its membership management,
<a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approving RFCs</a> and whitelisting Polkadot OpenGov
proposals.</p><p></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ranking-system">Ranking System<a href="#ranking-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ranking System" title="Direct link to Ranking System">​</a></h3><p>To prevent a small group of participants from gaining effective control over the network, this
system will adhere to three main principles:</p><ul><li>The Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change the parameters,
conduct rescues or move assets. Their only power in governance is reducing the effective timeline
on which a referendum takes place through <a href="#whitelisting">whitelisting</a>.</li><li>The Fellowship weights those with a higher rank more in the aggregate opinion. However, the weight
should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ opinions be insurmountable
compared to a coherent opinion from lower-ranked membership.</li><li>The Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership, aggregate levels of
expertise and ensure that its overall decision-making capacity strengthens over time.</li></ul><p>To support these conditions, the Fellowship will have a constitution that outlines the requirements
and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks can vote and
promote lower ranks based on this constitution.</p><p><strong>Demotion</strong> occurs automatically after a given period has elapsed, and the member is unable to
defend their position to their peers.</p><p><strong>Suspension</strong> can happen only through a referendum, which ensures that the Fellowship&#x27;s bias alone
does not necessarily result in expulsion.</p><p>To prevent the Fellowship from becoming a cabal (popularity with Fellowship peers alone should not
be enough to gain access to a top rank), gaining access to the top tiers of the ranks will require a
referendum.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whitelisting">Whitelisting<a href="#whitelisting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Whitelisting" title="Direct link to Whitelisting">​</a></h3><p>Polkadot OpenGov allows the Fellowship to authorize a new origin (known as &quot;Whitelisted-Caller&quot;) to
execute with Root-level privileges for calls that have been approved by the Fellowship (currently
only level-three fellows and above can vote for whitelist calls).</p><p>The <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_whitelist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitelist</a> pallet allows one
Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain operation. The pallet
verifies two things:</p><ul><li>The origin of the escalation is the Whitelisted-Root (i.e. that the referendum passed on this
track), and</li><li>The whitelist contains the given proposal (in the configuration of Polkadot OpenGov, it gets there
via a separate Fellowship referendum).</li></ul><p>If both conditions are true, the operation executes with Root-level privileges.</p><p>This system enables a new parallel Track (Whitelisted-Caller), whose parameters have less
restrictive passing parameters than Root in the short term. Through an open and transparent process,
a body of global experts on the Kusama
protocol have determined that the action is both safe and time-critical.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Submitting Whitelisted Proposals</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>For more information about how to submit a whitelisted proposal see the

preimage of a batch call that has <code>fellowshipCollective.addMember</code> and
<code>fellowshipCollective.promoteMember</code> on &quot;2/Proficients&quot; track. On Polkadot-JS UI for Polkadot
Collectives, navigate to Governance &gt; Fellowship &gt; Referenda and click on &quot;Add Preimage&quot;. This
preimage can be submitted by anyone.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="fellowship-add-promote-member-preimage" src="/assets/images/fellowship-add-member-preimage-90d52688c691ac21a26fd067a3ba6524.png" width="2156" height="1746" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>After the preimage is successfully noted, navigate to Governance &gt; Fellowship &gt; Referenda and click
on &quot;Submit Proposal&quot; (This button is active on the UI only if you have an account that belongs to
the Fellowship). Choose the appropriate track and the origin, and enter the preimage hash of the
batch call that adds and promotes the member.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="fellowship-add-promote-member-proposal" src="/assets/images/fellowship-add-member-proposal-5d832ecf298a03c8de37b001d43be34c.png" width="2150" height="1492" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>After the referendum is successfully executed, the member is added to the fellowship with &quot;rank 1&quot;.
For example, check the <a href="https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Referenda 23</a> on
the Collectives parachain. If a member has to be added and promoted to “rank 5”, the proposal has to
be submitted through track “6/Senior Experts” (Always a track with a rank higher). For example,
check the <a href="https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Referenda 25</a> on the
Collectives parachain.</p><p>Future plans include that public members can apply to become a Fellowship candidate by placing a
small deposit (which will be returned once they become members). Their candidacy will go through a
referendum to be approved to become a member.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resources"
