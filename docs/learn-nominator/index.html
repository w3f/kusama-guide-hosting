You could do so as validator, which
requires a node running 24/7. If you do not have such node or do not want to bother, you can still
earn DOT by nominating one or more validators.</p><p>By doing so, you become a nominator for the validator(s) of your choice. Pick your validators
carefully - if they do not behave properly, they will get slashed and you will lose DOT as well.
However, if they do follow the rules of the network, then you can share in staking rewards that they
generate.</p><p>While your DOT are staked by nominating a validator, they are &#x27;locked&#x27; (bonded). You can receive new
DOT in your account but you cannot stake as validator or transfer DOT away from your account. You
can <a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-unbond">un-nominate at any time</a> to stop staking your
funds. Keep in mind that the un-nomination is effective in the next era, and that un-nominating does
not automatically unbond your funds. There is an unbonding period of 7 days on Kusama and 28 days on
Polkadot before bonded funds can be transferred after issuing an unbond transaction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="active-vs-inactive-nomination">Active vs. Inactive Nomination<a class="hash-link" href="#active-vs-inactive-nomination" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When you go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Account actions</a> under staking

<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot">this</a> guide to configure it first. Your

active validator set, then you should see two of your nominations as &quot;waiting&quot;, and most likely one
as &quot;active&quot; and the rest as &quot;inactive&quot;. Active or inactive nomination means your nominated
validators have been elected to be in the validator set, whereas waiting means they did not get
elected. Generally, you will only have a single validator have an active nomination, which means
that you are directly supporting it with your stake this era and thus potentially receiving staking
rewards. Inactive nominators were validators that were elected for this era but which you are not
actively supporting. Every era, a new election will take place and you may be assigned a different
active nomination from among the validators you have selected.</p><p>If you are committing a very large amount of stake, then you may have more than one active
nomination. However, the election algorithm attempts to minimize this situation, and it should not
occur often, so you should almost always see only a single active nomination per era. See the

This is currently set to
256, but can be modified via governance. If more than
256 nominators nominate the same validator, it is &quot;oversubscribed&quot;, and
only the top 256 staked nominators (ranked by amount of stake) are paid
rewards. Other nominators will receive no rewards for that era, although their stake will still be
used to calculate entry into the active validator set.</p><p>Although it is difficult to determine exactly how many nominators will nominate a given validator in
the next era, one can estimate based on the current number of nominators. A validator with only 5
nominators in this era, for instance, is unlikely to have more than 256 in
the next era. An already-oversubscribed validator with 1000 nominators this era, however, is very
likely to be oversubscribed in the next era as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-election-solution-set">The Election Solution Set<a class="hash-link" href="#the-election-solution-set" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Determining which validators are in the active set and which nominators are nominating them creates
a very large graph mapping nominators to their respective validators. This &quot;solution set&quot; is
computed off-chain and submitted to the chain, which means it must fit in a single block. If there
are a large number of nominators, this means that some nominators must be eliminated. Currently,
nominators are sorted by amount of DOT staked and those with more DOT are prioritized. This means
that if you are staking with a small amount of DOT, you may not receive rewards. This minimal amount
is dynamic based on the number of validators, number of nominators, amount nominated, and other
factors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="receiving-rewards">Receiving Rewards<a class="hash-link" href="#receiving-rewards" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As long as you have nominated more than one validator candidate, at least one of them got elected,
and you are nominating with enough stake to get into the solution set, your bonded stake will be
fully distributed to one or more validators. That being said, you may not receive rewards if you
nominated very few validator candidates and no one got elected, or your stake is small and you only
selected oversubscribed validators, or the validator you are nominating has 100% commission. It is
generally wise to choose as many trustworthy validators as you can (up to
16) to reduce the risk of none of your nominated validators being

validator&#x27;s nominators. Any account can do this, although in practice validator operators often do
this as a service to their nominators. See the page on <a href="/docs/learn-simple-payouts">Simple Payouts</a> for

One useful tool for
assisting in this process is the Staking <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/targets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targets</a>
table. This displays potential validators in a table that can be evaluated and sorted using various
metrics. Outlined below are the relevant columns to consider, followed by a brief description of
each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>payout</strong>: How recently the validator has made it&#x27;s last reward payout to nominators.</p></li><li><p><strong>nominators</strong>: This column consists of two number values.</p><p>1) Amount of nominators currently bonded in the current era and considered <code>active</code>.</p><p>2) Total amount of nominators that nominated that validator.</p><ul><li><p>You may want to be cautious of validators with a high number of subscribers. A validator is
considered oversubscribed when more than 256 &#x27;active&#x27; nominators are assigned to the validator. In this
scenario only the top 256 nominators will receive rewards. The remaining nominators will
recieve nothing, however they can be slashed in the event that validator commits a
slashable offence.</p></li><li><p>Every nominator can select up to a maxium of 16 validators, which contributes towards maximizing
the probability of having the nominators stake applied to the validators active set. Nominating too
few validators could result in the nominators losing their rewards when none of them make it to active set or
when those Validator nodes stop validating. The election algorithm attempts to maximize the overall network
stake, while minimizing the variance of the active stake across the validators. For additional information on
the election process checkout the research behind

before the rewards are split among the nominators. As a nominator, you may think that the lowest
commission is best. However, this is not always true. Validators must be able to run at break-even
in order to sustainably continue operation. Independent validators that rely on the commission to
cover their server costs help to keep the network decentralized. Some validators, operated by
central exchanges etc., keep 100% of the commission to payout their staking service clients and
therefore do not provide any rewards to external nominators. Commission is just one piece of the
puzzle that you should consider when picking validators to nominate.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Staking Returns" src="/assets/images/polkadotjs_nominators_target-4b6618ad6611abdfa95dfd08551ac4d2.png" width="2878" height="1644" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As a nominator, if you only want to know the profit each validator made for each era, you can go to
the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/targets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targets</a> section under the staking page by
inputting the number of tokens you would like to stake to check it. Then, nominate those who have a
higher profit. However, that does not guarantee the right way to evaluate the validators&#x27; overall
performance.</p><p>It is worth taking into consideration &quot;own stake&quot; of a validator. This refers to the quantity of DOT
the validator has put up at stake themselves. A higher &quot;own stake&quot; amount can be considered as
having more &quot;skin in the game&quot;. This can imply increased trustworthiness. However, a validator not
having a large amount of &quot;own stake&quot; is not automatically untrustworthy, as the validator could be
nominating from a different address.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filter-out-validators-with-undesirable-traits">Filter Out Validators With Undesirable Traits<a class="hash-link" href="#filter-out-validators-with-undesirable-traits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>On the Targets page, you can filter out validators that have traits that may indicate an issue with
you nominating them. You can turn these filters on and off to help narrow down which validators you
should nominate. It is important to note that these traits aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;bad&quot;; however,
depending on your validator selection methodology, they may be characteristics that you would be
interested in filtering.</p><ul><li><strong>one validator per operator</strong>: Do not show groups of validators run by a single operator.</li><li><strong>comm. &lt; 20%</strong>: Do not show any validators with a commission of 20% or higher.</li><li><strong>with capacity</strong>: Do not show any validators who are currently operating
<a href="/docs/glossary#capacity">at capacity</a> (i.e., could potentially be oversubscribed).</li><li><strong>recent payouts</strong>: Only show validators that have recently caused a
<a href="/docs/learn-simple-payouts">payout to be issued</a>. Note that anyone can cause a payout to occur; it
does not have to be the operator of a validator.</li><li><strong>currently elected</strong>: Only show validators that are currently in the active set (i.e., they have
been elected to produce blocks this era).</li><li><strong>with an identity</strong>: Only show validators that have set an <a href="/docs/learn-identity">identity</a>. Note
that this identity does not have to be verified by a registrar for the validator to show up in the
list.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="review-your-validators-history">Review Your Validators&#x27; History<a class="hash-link" href="#review-your-validators-history" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>How the validator acted in the past may be a good indicator of how they will act in the future. An
example of problematic behavior would be if a validator is regularly offline, their nominators most
likely would get fewer rewards than others. More importantly, when many validators are
<a href="/docs/learn-staking#unresponsiveness">unreachable</a>, those nominators who staked with them will be
slashed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Validator Stats" src="/assets/images/polkadotjs_validator_stats-4b433d0c856a8bf0d2bb53cea027e009.png" width="2880" height="1652" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Thus, to be a smart nominator, it would be better to query their
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/query/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">histories</a> to see statistics such as blocks
produced, rewards and slashes, and <a href="/docs/learn-identity">identity</a> (if they have it set). Moreover, a
nominator should do comprehensive research on their validator candidates - they should go over the
validators&#x27; websites to see who they are, what kind of infrastructure setup they are using,
reputation, the vision behind the validator, and more.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-aware-of-the-risks-of-single-operators-with-multiple-validators">Be Aware of The Risks of Single Operators with Multiple Validators<a class="hash-link" href="#be-aware-of-the-risks-of-single-operators-with-multiple-validators" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Recall that slashing is an additive function; the more validators that are offline or equivocate in
a given session, the harsher the penalties. Since validators that are controlled by a single entity
are more at risk of a &quot;synchronized&quot; failure, nominating them implies a greater risk of having a
large slash of your nominated funds. Generally, it is safer to nominate validators whose behavior is
independent from others in as many ways as possible (different hardware, geographic location, owner,
etc.).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="avoiding-oversubscribed-validators">Avoiding Oversubscribed Validators<a class="hash-link" href="#avoiding-oversubscribed-validators" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you are not nominating with a large number of DOTs, you should try to avoid
<a href="/docs/glossary#oversubscribed">oversubscribed</a> validators. It is not always easy to
calculate if the validator selected will be oversubscribed in the next session; one way to avoid
choosing potentially oversubscribed validators is to filter out any that are
<a href="/docs/glossary#capacity">at capacity</a> on the Targets page.</p><p>Finally, if you have a very small amount of DOTs, you may not be able to have your nomination fit
into the election set. The nominator to validator mapping has to fit in a single block, and if there
are too many nominators, the lowest-staked nominations will be dropped. This value is obviously
dynamic and will vary over time. If you review the lowest amount of nominations that are occurring
on current validators, you can get a good idea of how many DOTs will likely be necessary to have
your nomination earn you rewards. You can read the blog post
