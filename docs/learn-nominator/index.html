KSM and want to earn fresh
KSM. You could do so as a validator, which
requires experience setting up a node and running and maintaining it 24/7.</p><p>On Kusama you can also earn
KSM by nominating one or more validators. Doing
so makes you a nominator for the validator(s) you chose. Pick your validators carefully - if they do
not behave properly, they will get slashed, and you will lose
KSM. However, if they follow the network rules,
you can share the staking rewards they generate.</p><p>While your KSM are staked for nominations, they
are &#x27;locked&#x27; (bonded). You can
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot">stop nominating at any time</a>, but remember
that the action is effective in the next era and does not automatically unbond your funds. Unbonding
is a separate action, and it takes effect after the unbonding period, which is
7-day long on Kusama. This is
calculated by taking the <strong>bonding duration</strong> (in eras), multiplying it by the <strong>length of a single
era</strong> (in hours), and dividing by the <strong>hours in a day</strong> (24). Example:
(28 × 6 ÷ 24 = 7 days). A
staking lock will be visible on the Polkadot-JS UI during the unbonding period, and after it, the
staking lock can be unlocked, and the bonded funds become free balance you can transfer.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Fast Unstaking feature is live!</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>If you accidentally bonded your KSM or your

One helpful tool to
choose validators is the Staking <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/targets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targets</a> table in
the Polkadot-JS UI. This allows sorting validators using various metrics. Below are the relevant
metrics shown as an example, followed by a brief description of each.</p><table><thead><tr><th>validator</th><th>payout</th><th>nominators</th><th>comm.</th><th>total stake</th><th>own stake</th><th>return</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>recently</td><td>1 (<code>active</code>) 4 (<code>all</code>)</td><td>3%</td><td>1.6 MDOT</td><td>8500 DOT</td><td>17.8%</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><p><strong>payout</strong>: How recently the validator made its last reward payout to nominators.</p></li><li><p><strong>nominators</strong>: This column consists of two number values. The <strong>active</strong> count (left number) is
the number of nominators whose stake is baking the validator in the current era. In this case
Validator A has one active nominator. The total or <strong>all</strong> count (right number) is the number of
all nominators who nominated Validator A. This includes the active count and all the other
nominators whose stake in the current era is baking other validators.</p><p>Be cautious of validators with a high number of subscribers. A validator is considered
oversubscribed when more than
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
active nominators are assigned to the validator. In this scenario, only the top
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
nominators (sorted by stake) will receive rewards. The remaining nominators will not be rewarded.
However, they can be slashed if the validator commits a slashable offense.</p><p>Every nominator can select up to a maximum of
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
validators, which contributes towards maximizing the probability of having the nominator’s stake
applied to the validators active set. Nominating too few validators could result in the nominators
not receiving their rewards when none of them make it to the active set or when those validators
stop validating. The election algorithm attempts to maximize the overall network stake while
minimizing the variance of the active stake across the validators. For additional information on
the election process, check out the research behind
<a href="https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/protocols/NPoS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nominated proof-of-stake</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>comm.</strong>: Total commission kept by the validator (100% means the validator will keep all rewards
, and thus nominators will not receive them). A validator&#x27;s commission is the percentage of the
validator reward taken by the validator before the rewards are split among the nominators. As a
nominator, you may think that choosing validators with the lowest commission is best. However,
validators must be able to run at break-even to continue operations sustainably. Independent
validators that rely on the commission to cover their server costs help to keep the network
decentralized. Some validators, operated by central exchanges, etc., keep 100% of the commission
to payout their staking service clients and therefore do not provide any rewards to external
nominators. The commission is just one piece of the puzzle you should consider when picking
nominating validators.</p></li><li><p><strong>total stake</strong>: The total amount of KSM tokens
staked by nominators and the validator (i.e. own stake, see below).</p></li><li><p><strong>own stake</strong>: The amount of KSM tokens the
validator has put up as a stake. A higher own stake can be considered as having more &quot;skin in the
game&quot;. This can imply increased trustworthiness. However, a validator not having a large amount of
&quot;own stake&quot; is not automatically untrustworthy, as the validator could nominate from a different
address.</p></li><li><p><strong>return</strong>: Average annual yield paid out to nominators (i.e. number of rewards divided by the
number of bonded tokens). Note that nominating those with a higher yield may not guarantee similar
future performance.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Staking Returns" src="/assets/images/nominators_target-d8652ac89f3cbb16528cd68808a32cf0.png" width="2169" height="509" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On the Targets page, you can use different filters to select validators with specific traits (where
a trait is a combination of the metrics above). Available filters are:</p><ul><li><strong>one validator per operator</strong>: Do not show groups of validators run by a single operator. It
shows small operators only who will likely have a higher commission and higher self-stake.
Nominating only small operators might not always guarantee staking rewards, but it helps to keep

nominators are sorted by the amount of DOT staked, and those with more DOT are prioritized. This
means that you may not receive rewards if you are staking with a small amount of DOT. This minimal

next era, one can estimate based on the current number of nominators. A validator with only 5
nominators in this era, for instance, is unlikely to have more than

in the next era. However, an already-oversubscribed validator with 1000 nominators this era is very
likely to be oversubscribed in the next era as well.</p><p>If you are not nominating with a large number of DOTs, you should try to avoid
<a href="/docs/glossary#oversubscribed">oversubscribed</a> validators. It is not always easy to
calculate if the validator selected will be oversubscribed in the next session; one way to avoid
choosing potentially oversubscribed validators is to filter out any that are

need to stake more DOT to get into the election set. The nominator-to-validator mapping solution
needs to be evaluated within a single block duration, and if there are too many nominators, the
lowest-staked nominations will be dropped from even being considered to be part of the electing set.

active validator set; then you should see two of your nominations as &quot;waiting&quot;, and most likely one
as &quot;active&quot; and the rest as &quot;inactive&quot;. Active or inactive nomination means your nominated
validators have been elected to be in the validator set, whereas waiting means they did not get
elected. Generally, you will only have a single validator have an active nomination, which means
that you are directly supporting it with your stake this era and thus potentially receiving staking
rewards. Inactive nominators were validators elected for this era but which you are not actively
supporting. Every era, a new election will take place, and you may be assigned a different active
nomination from the validators you selected.</p><p>If you are committing a very large stake, you may have more than one active nomination. However, the
election algorithm attempts to minimize this situation, and it should not occur often, so you should
