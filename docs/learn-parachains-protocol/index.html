process that can be carried out repeatedly and in parallel for each parachain connected to the Relay
Chain. The protocol allows the network to be efficiently sharded among parachains while maintaining
strong security guarantees. The Availability and Validity (AnV) Protocol describes the Parachain
Protocol from the perspective of availability and validity. on).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="main-actors">Main Actors<a href="#main-actors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Main Actors" title="Direct link to Main Actors">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="validators"><a href="/docs/learn-validator">Validators</a><a href="#validators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to validators" title="Direct link to validators">â€‹</a></h3><p>They are responsible for validating the proposed parachain&#x27;s blocks by checking the
<strong>Proof-of-Validity</strong> (PoV) of the blocks and ensuring the PoV remains available for a designated

or fully confiscated by the network in case of misbehavior.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collators"><a href="/docs/learn-collator">Collators</a><a href="#collators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to collators" title="Direct link to collators">â€‹</a></h3><p>They create the PoV that validators know how to check.

different role in relation to the Kusama
network. Instead of packaging the state transitions and producing the next parachain blocks as
collators do, fishermen will watch this process and ensure no invalid state transitions are
included.</p><p>To address the motivation behind the Fishermen design consideration, the current
<a href="#assignments--secondary-checks">secondary backing checkers</a> perform a similar role in relation to
the Kusama network. From a security
standpoint, security is based on having at least one honest validator either among parachain
validators or secondary checker (more about this later on).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="protocols-summary">Protocols&#x27; Summary<a href="#protocols-summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Protocols&#x27; Summary" title="Direct link to Protocols&#x27; Summary">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="parachain-protocol">Parachain Protocol<a href="#parachain-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Parachain Protocol" title="Direct link to Parachain Protocol">â€‹</a></h3><p>The parachain protocol is divided into two main phases:</p><ul><li><a href="#inclusion-pipeline"><strong>Inclusion Pipeline</strong></a>: Collators send parachain blocks (parablocks) with

The block
changes its status through this path as follows:</p><ul><li>Candidate: A block with its PoV is put forward by a collator to a para-validator (in this case
V1). The candidate block is shown as a white square with one white tick mark at the side (PoV from
the collator). Note the candidate is not valid yet and can still fail to be included in the Relay
Chain.</li><li>Seconded: The block is put forward by the para-validator V1 to other para-validators (in this case
V2 and V3). The seconded block is shown as a white square with a white tick mark and a yellow tick
mark on top of it. The yellow mark show the PoV from para-validator V1.</li><li>Backable: The block validity is attested by a majority of the para-validators. The backable block
is shown as white square with a white tick mark and three yellow tick marks on top of it. The
yellow marks show the PoV from the para-validators, while the white mark the PoV from the
collator.</li><li>Backed: The block is backed and noted in a fork on the Relay Chain by a relay chain block author
(in this case V4). The backed block is shown as a square with white background and yellow border
enclosing a &quot;B&quot;. The backed block can still fail to be included in the Relay Chain. Note that for
simplicity here the backed parachain block is represented within the Relay Chain block, but in
reality a relay chain block does not contain the parablocks themselves (more about this later).</li><li>Pending availability: The block is backed but not considered available yet.</li><li>Included: The block is backed and considered available (we have a parablock). Included parablocks

Routine</strong> (these validators are called para-validators). Para-validators establish a connection with
collators, which propose candidate blocks together with Proof-of-Validity (PoV) to para-validators
via the <strong>Collator Distribution Subsystem</strong>.</p><p>Para-validators participate in the <strong>Candidate Backing Subsystem</strong>. A para-validator needs to check
if the candidate block follows the
<a href="/docs/learn-parachains#state-transitions">state transition</a> rules of the parachain. Because
states are stored within Merke trees, a para-validator can verify state transitions without having
access to the entire state, but it needs:</p><ul><li>The block candidate (list of state transitions)</li><li>The values in the parachain&#x27;s database that the block modifies</li><li>The hashes of the unaffected points in the Merke tree</li></ul><p>This set of information is the proof-of-validity (PoV).</p><p>Once a para-validator has the PoV, it gossips this information to the other para-validators, who
check the candidate block against the PoV. Candidates that gather more than half of signed validity
statements are considered <strong>backable</strong> (i.e. they <em>seem</em> to represent a valid state transition), and
their backing is the set of signed statements. The para-validators can then start to construct the
<a href="#candidate-receipts"><strong>candidate receipt</strong></a> (this is what goes into the Relay Chain block) and an
<a href="#erasure-codes"><strong>erasure coding</strong></a> (this is what will make the parablock available, more on this
later on) that will be sent to all validators in the network.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Polkadot guarantees valid state transitions, not valid states</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Kusama validators do not inspect every value

para-validators are a small subset of all validators. Thus, it is possible to have the majority of
them dishonest. Later on, we will see that more validators with come in to help to make sure the
parablock is fully valid.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="relay-chain-submission-phase">Relay Chain Submission Phase<a href="#relay-chain-submission-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Relay Chain Submission Phase" title="Direct link to Relay Chain Submission Phase">â€‹</a></h3><p>The <a href="#candidate-receipts">receipt</a> of the backable parablock is added to the Relay Chain transaction
queue together with other receipts from other parachains. Receipts are gossiped around, and when a
relay chain block author wins <a href="/docs/learn-consensus#block-production-babe">BABE</a> slot leadership, it
will select a candidate receipt to include in a block on a fork of the Relay Chain.</p><p>A block author can note up to 1 backable candidate for each parachain to be included in the Relay
Chain block alongside its backing. Once included in a fork of the Relay Chain the candidate is
considered <strong>backed</strong> in that fork. The candidate is considered to be in <strong>&quot;pending availability&quot;</strong>
status, and it can only be considered a part of the parachain once proven available. Remember, at
this stage validators of the Relay Chain already received the
<a href="#erasure-codes">erasure coding information</a> of that specific parablock.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="availability-and-unavailability-phase">Availability and Unavailability Phase<a href="#availability-and-unavailability-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Availability and Unavailability Phase" title="Direct link to Availability and Unavailability Phase">â€‹</a></h3><p>During the availability and unavailability phases, the validators will participate to <strong>Availability
Distribution Subsystem</strong> to ensure availability of the candidate. They gossip the
<a href="#erasure-codes">erasure coded</a> pieces among the network. At least 1/3 + 1 validators must report
that they possess their piece of the code word. Once this threshold of validators has been reached,
the network can consider the candidate block available. The block is graduated to being a full
parachain block, and its header will be included in that fork of the Relay Chain. The information
about the candidate availability is noted in the subsequent relay chain blocks of that fork.</p><p>The availability check by the block author ensures that
Kusama will only include blocks for which
the validators distributed their erasure-coded chunks, but it does not guarantee their validity.
Because the number of para-validators on each parachain is so low, collusion is a reasonable
concern. By separating block production (<a href="/docs/learn-consensus#block-production-babe">BABE</a>) from
finality (<a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#finality-gadget-grandpa">GRANDPA</a>),
Kusama can perform extra validity checks
after a block is produced but before it is finalized.</p><p>Thus, once the parablock is considered available and part of the parachain, it is still &quot;pending
approval&quot;. The Inclusion Pipeline must conclude for a specific parachain before a new block can be
accepted on that parachain. After inclusion, the <a href="#approval-process">Approval Process</a> starts and it
makes sure the block is valid, and it can run for many parachain blocks at once.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="failure-to-inclusion">Failure to Inclusion<a href="#failure-to-inclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Failure to Inclusion" title="Direct link to Failure to Inclusion">â€‹</a></h3><p>The candidate can fail to be included in the parachain in any of the following ways:</p><ul><li>The collator cannot propagate the block to any of the assigned validators.</li><li>The candidate is not backed by validators participating in the Candidate Backing subsystem.</li><li>A relay chain block author does not select the candidate.</li><li>The candidate&#x27;s PoV is not considered available within a timeout, and the block is discarded from
the Relay Chain.</li></ul><p>Signed negative statements will lead to a <a href="#disputes">dispute</a>, and if there are false negatives,
whoever will be on the wrong side (once the dispute is resolved) will be slashed. False positives
can also happen; those actors responsible for it will also be slashed. To detect false positives,
PoV information must be available after the block has been added to the Relay Chain so that
validators can check the work. However, as a part of the data
<a href="#availability-and-unavailability-phase">availability scheme</a>, they are made available on the
network for a certain period so that the validators can perform the required checks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="approval-process">Approval Process<a href="#approval-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Approval Process" title="Direct link to Approval Process">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview-1">Overview<a href="#overview-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">â€‹</a></h3><p>Once the parablock is considered available and part of the parachain, it is still &quot;pending
approval&quot;. At this stage, the parablock is tentatively included in the parachain, although more
confirmation is necessary. The validators assigned to the parachain (i.e. the parachain validators)
are sampled from a validator set assumed to be 1/3 dishonest in the worst-case scenario. In this
case, it is likely that the majority of the random para-validators sampled for a specific parachain
are dishonest and can back a candidate wrongly. To address this, the <strong>Approval Process</strong> allows
detecting misbehavior after the fact without allocating more para-validators, which would ultimately
reduce the system&#x27;s throughput. As a parablock can accept children blocks after being considered
available, failure to pass the approval process will invalidate the parablock and its descendants
(children blocks). Only the validators who backed the block in question will be slashed, not those
who backed the descendants.</p><p>The approval pipeline can be divided into the following steps:</p><ol><li>Parablocks included by the Inclusion Pipeline are pending approval for a time window known as the
<strong>secondary checking window</strong>.</li><li>During the secondary checking window, validators (secondary checkers) randomly self-select based
on a <a href="/docs/learn-cryptography#vrf">VRF</a> lottery to perform secondary checks on each of the
parablock.</li><li>Secondary checkers acquire the parablock with PoV (erasure codings are necessary to reconstruct
PoV) and re-run the validation function.</li><li>Secondary checkers gossip about the results of their checks. Contradictory results lead to an
escalation in which all validators must check the block. The validators on the losing side will
be slashed.</li><li>At the end of the process the parablock is either approved or rejected.</li></ol><p>The figure below shows the path of a parachain block when it exits the Inclusion Pipeline, and
enters the Approval Process. The parablock becomes accepted when it is backed, available and
<strong>undisputed</strong>. The parablock is checked a second time by a subset of validators (V5, V6 and V7),
and if there are no contradictory results the block is approved and gossiped to other relay chain
validators. Note the parablock after secondary checks is shown as a square with a white background a
yellow border enclosing an &quot;I&quot; (stands for <em>included</em>), and three white ticks (one for each
secondary check). Approved para-blocks are shown as yellow squares.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="parachain-approval-process" src="/assets/images/parachain-approval-process-a025570e14282288fee420715c4e3030.png" width="1920" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assignments--secondary-checks">Assignments &amp; Secondary Checks<a href="#assignments--secondary-checks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assignments &amp; Secondary Checks" title="Direct link to Assignments &amp; Secondary Checks">â€‹</a></h3><p>Having a bad parablock on a fork of the relay chain is not catastrophic as long as the block is not

para-headers. Parachain blocks are within the parachain. Thus, it makes more sense to think of
relay-chain blocks as having been approved instead of parablocks that have been approved. A
relay-chain block containing information about approved parablocks can be considered approved as
long as its parent relay-chain block is also approved. Thus, the validity of a relay-chain block
depends on the validity of its ancestry.</p></div></div><p>Validators perform two main actions in the Approval Process:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#assignments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignments</a></strong>
determine which validators perform approval checks on which candidates, ensuring each candidate
receives enough random checkers. This stage tracks approval votes to identify when
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#no-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no-show</a> approval
checks take suspiciously long. It also tracks relay chain
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-avoid-slashing/#equivocation">equivocations</a> to
determine when adversaries possibly gained foreknowledge about assignments and add more checks in
those cases. Assignees determine their own assignments to check specific candidates using two or
three
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#assignment-criteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assignment criteria</a>,
which are based on two possible
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a> about the
relay chain block that included the candidate (i.e. declared the candidate available).
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#announcements--notices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignment notices</a>
are gossiped among nodes so that all validators know which validators should check which
candidates, and if any candidate requires more checkers.</li><li><strong>Approval checks</strong> perform the checks by obtaining the candidate, verifying its validity, sending
out the approval vote, or initiating a dispute. Approval checks have a no-show timeout window
(i.e. longer than one relay chain slot) to succeed in reconstructing the candidate block, redo its
erasure coding to check the candidate receipt, and recheck the candidate block itself. A validator
becomes tagged as a no-show if it does not approve or dispute within the no-show timeout window.
Because validators can be overloaded with assignments, they can intentionally delay sending their
assignment notice to avoid creating no-shows (see more in
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#assignment-postponement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignment postponement</a>).</li></ul><p>These two steps first run as off-chain consensus protocols using messages gossiped among all
validators, and then as on-chain record of those protocols&#x27; progress. The on-chain protocol is
needed to provide rewards for the off-chain protocol. The
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#on-chain-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on-chain verification</a>
has two phases: a) assignments notices and approval votes are recorded in a relay chain block, and
b) in another relay chain block notes are fed into the approval code.</p><p>The gossiped messages are of two types, assignment notices, and approval votes, and are singed with
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#approval-keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval keys</a>.
Such keys are part of the <a href="/docs/learn-cryptography/#session-keys">session keys</a> used by validators.
Briefly, approval keys are:</p><ul><li><strong>Approval assignment keys</strong> that are sr25519 keys used only for assignment criteria
<a href="/docs/learn-cryptography#vrf">VRF</a>.</li><li><strong>Approval vote keys</strong> that are ed25519 and would only sign off on a candidate parablock validity.</li></ul><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>For detailed information about the approval process, see dedicated section in

For
Kusama to scale to hundreds of parachains,
PoV need to be represented by something smaller on the Relay Chain: candidate receipts. A
para-validator constructs a candidate receipt for a parachain block by signing:</p><ul><li>The parachain ID.</li><li>The collator&#x27;s ID and signature.</li><li>A hash of the parent block&#x27;s candidate receipt.</li><li>A Merkle root of the block&#x27;s erasure-coded pieces.</li><li>A Merkle root of any outgoing messages.</li><li>A hash of the block.</li><li>The state root of the parachain before block execution.</li><li>The state root of the parachain after block execution.</li></ul><p>This information is of constant size, while the actual PoV block of the parachain can be variable
length. It is enough information for anyone that obtains the full PoV block to verify the state
transition contained inside of it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="erasure-codes">Erasure Codes<a href="#erasure-codes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Erasure Codes" title="Direct link to Erasure Codes">â€‹</a></h2><p>Before sending the candidate receipt to the Relay Chain transaction queue, the para-validator who
constructs the receipt must also construct an erasure coding of the parachain block.</p><p>An erasure coding takes a message (in this case, the parachain block and PoV) and creates a set of
smaller messages such that you can reconstruct the original message by obtaining a fraction of the
smaller messages. In the case of Kusama the
total number of smaller messages is equal to the total number of validators and the fraction is 1/3.</p><p>The para-validator creates the erasure coding chunks, puts them into their Merkle tree, and sends
out each chunk (together with the candidate receipt) to a corresponding validator on the Relay
Chain. Validators who receive the receipts with an erasure coding chunk will include the receipt in
the Relay Chain queue, where an author can include it in a block.</p><p>The type of erasure codes used by Kusama&#x27;s
availability scheme are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reed-Solomon</a> codes, which
already enjoy a battle-tested application in technology outside the blockchain industry. One example
is found in the compact disk industry. CDs use Reed-Solomon codes to correct any missing data due to
inconsistencies on the disk face such as dust particles or scratches.</p><p>In Kusama, the erasure codes are used to
keep parachain state available to the system without requiring all validators to keep tabs on all
the parachains. Instead, validators share smaller pieces of the data and can later reconstruct the
entire data under the assumption that 1/3+1 of the validators can provide their pieces of the data.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>The 1/3+1 threshold of validators that must be responsive to construct the full parachain state data

This does not apply to
backed blocks that are not included. To ensure nothing invalid ends up in the finalized relay chain,
there are approval checks (described above) and disputes. The latter ensures that each attempt to
include something invalid is caught and the offending validators are punished.</p><p>Disputes are <em>independent from a particular fork</em>, while backing and approval operate on particular
forks. The approval voting stops if an alternative fork (which might not contain the
currently-approved candidate) is finalized. The sole purpose of the approval process is to make sure
invalid blocks are not finalized. However, even though the danger is past and the offending
validators did not manage to get the invalid block approved, those validators need to get slashed
for the attempt.</p><p>A dispute stems from a disagreement between two or more validators. For this to happen, a bad actor
needs to distribute an invalid block to honest validators. Scenarios leading to a dispute can be one
of the followings (ordered from most to least important):</p><ul><li>A parablock included on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li><li>A parablock backed on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li><li>A parablock seconded, but not backed on any branch of the relay chain, is bad</li></ul><p>Checking a parachain block requires three pieces of data: the parachain validator code, the
availability of data, and the candidate receipt. The validator code is available on-chain and
published ahead of time. Thus, a dispute process begins with the availability to ensure the
availability of the data. Such a process will conclude quickly if the data is already available,
otherwise, the initiator of the dispute must make it available.</p><p>Disputes have both off- and on-chain components. Slashing is handled on-chain, so votes by
validators on either side of the dispute must be placed on-chain. Moreover, a dispute on one branch
of the chain must be transposed to all active branches so that misbehavior can be punished in all
possible histories. There is, thus, a distinction between <em>local</em> (the one we are looking at) and
<em>remote</em> disputes relative to a particular branch of the relay chain.</p><p>Disputes can be divided into three different phases:</p><ul><li><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-disputes.html#initiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispute initiation</a>:
Disputes are initiated by any validator who finds their opinion on the validity of a parablock in
opposition to another issued statement. The initiation begins off-chain by only nodes perceiving
that a parablock is bad. The validator can be one of the para-validators (i.e. one of the backers)
or one of the approval checkers. Note that if the dispute occurs during the backing phase, the
initiator must make the data available while if the dispute occurs during the approval process the
data is already available.</li><li><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-disputes.html#dispute-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispute participation</a>:
Once becoming aware of the dispute, all validators must participate.</li><li><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-disputes.html#dispute-conclusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispute conclusion</a>:
Disputes conclude after a 2/3 supermajority is reached on either side. Disputes may also conclude
after a timeout. This will only happen if the majority of validators are unable to vote for some
reason.</li></ul><p>The on-chain component of the dispute can be initiated by providing any two conflicting votes and it
also waits for a 2/3 supermajority on either side. The component also tracks which parablocks have
already been disputed so that the same parablock can be disputed only once on any branch of the
relay chain. Inclusion is halted for the parachain until the dispute resolves.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>For detailed information about disputes, see dedicated section in

Chain (we say the block is backed). The relay chain block author is selected by
<a href="/docs/learn-consensus#block-production-babe">BABE</a>, which is a forkful algorithm. This means that
different block authors are chosen at the same time, and they may not work on the same block parent
(i.e. the representations in the previous figures are simplistic). Also, the sets of validators and
parachains are not fixed, and the validators&#x27; assignments to parachains is also flexible.</p><p>We say that the network is <strong>asynchronous</strong> since there will be validators who have received a block
and other validators who did not. Thus, the network is variable, and it exists in multiple states.
In the figure below (<em>left</em>), Group 1 received block C while Group 2 did not due to network
asynchrony. Validators in Group 2 can build another block on top of B, called C&#x27;. Assume that
afterward, some validators become aware of both C and C&#x27; while others remain aware of one of them
(<em>right</em>). Validators in Group 3 must be aware of the network state in each head (C and Câ€™), and
they may contribute to some or full extent on both. It is possible that due to network asynchrony,
two forks may grow in parallel for some time, but eventually, one fork will be chosen by the
finality gadget. In the absence of an adversarial network, it is unlikely that two forks will
coexist for some time as there will be validators aware of both chain heads.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="parachain-forks" src="/assets/images/parachain-forks-b3d4a4e9161292fb63e1b86888a18579.png" width="1920" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-resources">Further Resources<a href="#further-resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further Resources" title="Direct link to Further Resources">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://polkadot.network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Path of a Parachain Block</a> - Article by
