yourself and your non-refundable crypto assets from scammers. If you ever feel you are being

done to recover your funds. If a scammer gets a hold of your seed phrase, they can transfer all
of your funds to their account in seconds. It is better to be safe than to risk all of your
tokens.</p></li><li><p>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. People, especially celebrities, do not give
away crypto for free. Even if they wanted to, they could just ask for your address as opposed to
having you send them tokens.</p></li><li><p>Scams are absolutely rife in this space. It is easy and cheap to set a scam up, and hard to shut
one down. Therefore, the onus is on the user to be as diligent as possible in avoiding them.</p></li><li><p>If you can, try to always verify new information that you see with an official source, such as
<a href="/docs/community">Polkadot network&#x27;s official blog</a> or
<a href="https://support.polkadot.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot&#x27;s Official Support</a>. Often scammers will fake a
website or a blog post, but if you check it against a secondary source you will reduce the
chances of being scammed.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution alert alert--warning admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>caution</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>With crowdloans active on the network, it is very important to know how to safely participate.
Fake crowdloan campaigns may present an attractive target for scammers. If you are participating
in a network-native crowdloan, <strong>never send your tokens to an address.</strong> Native crowdloan
contributions are made with a special transaction using a campaign index, where the contributed
assets remain locked until the end of the lease period. Legitimate teams will not ask you to send
your assets to an address to participate in a network-native crowdloan.</p></div></div></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="some-common-types-of-scams">Some Common Types of Scams<a class="hash-link" href="#some-common-types-of-scams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Private messages sent to you over Telegram, Twitter, and other social media - admins or employees
will never contact you.</li><li>&quot;Giveaways&quot; advertising that you &quot;send us some DOT/KSM, we&#x27;ll send you double back&quot;.</li><li>Sites where you need to enter your seed phrase in order to &quot;sync&quot; your account, claim tokens,
unblock transactions etc.</li><li>Emails asking for DOT/KSM private keys/seeds/etc., posing as a member of any of our teams.</li><li>Scammers will take official videos, add &quot;giveaway&quot; text around it so that it looks like the
giveaway is supported by Polkadot, Web3 Foundation, Parity, or another well-known entity.</li><li>Many scammers will create nearly perfect imitations of sites - always triple-check the URL.</li><li>People offering to help you stake or get rewards.</li><li>People responding to questions that you asked publicly in a private chat.</li><li>Advertisements pointing to imitations of sites asking you to enter your seed words.</li></ul><p>These are just some of the types of scams. Scammers are inventing new ones all the time. In general,
do not trust anyone messaging you that you did not message yourself, and be wary of anyone
attempting to help you or offer you a &quot;deal&quot;.</p><p>Scammers will often imitate usernames, profile pictures, etc. of well-known members of the
community. Often the differences in these accounts will be very minor, such as <code>joe_sm1th</code> or
<code>jo_smith</code> instead of <code>joe_smith</code>.</p><p>Scammers will often make it seem like the &quot;deal&quot; is only available for a limited time. Do not be
tricked by this, it is always better to confirm than to risk losing everything.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="admins-will-never-contact-you-directly">Admins will never contact you directly<a class="hash-link" href="#admins-will-never-contact-you-directly" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you&#x27;ve received a message from an admin over Telegram, ignore it.

anyone. If you are concerned a wallet could be fake, please check out our official list of supported
<a href="/docs/build-wallets">wallets</a>.</p><p>Some simple things that you can do to keep your assets and information secure from hackers:</p><ul><li>Keep your seed phrase only on paper, in a secret and secure location.</li><li>DO NOT keep your seed phrase on any electronic medium, like the cloud, on your computer, on a USB
drive, etc.</li><li>Never enter your seed or mnemonic phrase directly into a website.</li><li>Your seed phrase is meant as a backup in case you lose access to your wallet. Use it only for that
purpose and only in wallets you&#x27;ve used before and trust.</li><li>Your passwords should be strong and unique. It is recommended that you use a
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">password manager app</a>
to create and store your passwords.</li><li>Keep your computer free of malware. Although an antivirus can be of great help, it&#x27;s not a
panacea. Safe browsing and downloading is the only way to be sure your computer is clean.</li><li>Avoid installing browser extensions from sources you don&#x27;t trust explicitly.</li><li>Store your assets in cold storage, like a hardware wallet or
<a href="https://www.parity.io/signer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parity Signer</a>.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="always-check-the-source">Always check the source<a class="hash-link" href="#always-check-the-source" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For any potential scam, always be sure to do a background check on the source, i.e, look at any
username, email, YouTube channel name, URL, etc. If something seems fishy, that&#x27;s because it likely
is. Never enter any personal data if you feel the source could be a scam. Feel free to check with
<a href="https://support.polkadot.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot&#x27;s official support</a>..</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="check-twice-before-sending-dotksm">Check twice before sending DOT/KSM<a class="hash-link" href="#check-twice-before-sending-dotksm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A good practice to take into consideration is to verify the address you are sending crypto to. If
you don&#x27;t know that account, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be sending your assets there. It&#x27;s your
responsibility to make sure that you understand where you are sending your funds. Crypto is a
decentralized space and your only recourse if a mistake is made is by appealing to the council (who
usually will not get involved in matters of mistaken transfers - see below).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="install-the-polkadotjs-extension">Install the Polkadot{.js} extension<a class="hash-link" href="#install-the-polkadotjs-extension" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The extension uses crowd-sourced <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-phishing measures</a> to
automatically prevent your browser from displaying known phishing or scam sites. They will be
blocked upon loading, helping to prevent you from visiting these sites and thus falling for them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-official-sites">Our official sites<a class="hash-link" href="#our-official-sites" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You can use the following list of our official domains to make sure that you&#x27;re visiting an official
site:</p><ul><li><a href="https://polkadot.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://polkadot.network</a></li><li><a href="https://polkadot.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://polkadot.io</a></li><li><a href="https://kusama.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://kusama.network</a></li><li><a href="https://web3.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://web3.foundation</a></li><li><a href="https://parity.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://parity.io</a></li><li><a href="https://substrate.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://substrate.io</a></li></ul><p>Of course, many projects building on Polkadot and Kusama that use similar names. If, however, a site
poses as Polkadot, Kusama, Web3 Foundation, or Parity on a domain not listed above, then it&#x27;s most
likely a scam.</p><p>Besides those, there are also <code>polkadot.js.org</code> and <code>dotapps.io</code> that host our web wallet and other
tools.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-got-scammed---what-can-i-do">I Got Scammed - What Can I Do?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-got-scammed---what-can-i-do" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In the unfortunate case of having fallen for a scam, there is likely nothing anyone can do to help
you restore your funds. Polkadot and Kusama are decentralized platforms and while we do have
governance functionality that could technically allow for funds freezing or refunds, it is
impossible to prove that you are the original owner, or that you did not sell the tokens and are
trying to reclaim them. Additionally, even with addresses that are obviously in possession of a
scammer, governance is a slow-moving process; even under ideal conditions, it would take over 56
days to come into effect. The thief could easily monitor the network for governance proposals that
would affect their ill-gotten gains and move them to a new address before the proposal is enacted.</p><p>You could put together a full account of the transactions and chat messages accompanied by
screenshots and explanations, but there are no guarantee stakeholders on the network will help you
restore the funds as it would set a dangerous precedent. In fact, there have been several attempts
on Polkadot in the past and none have been passed. It is safer for the network and for future users
to consider the money lost. Still, your detailed account of the situation might help prevent others
from falling for the same thing so we recommend retracing your steps and talking publicly about
them, if it&#x27;s not too private.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2022-09-27T10:49:01.000Z">Sep 27, 2022</time></b> by <b>JE Boska</b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#essential-rules" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Essential rules:</a><ul><li><a href="#some-common-types-of-scams" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Some Common Types of Scams</a></li><li><a href="#admins-will-never-contact-you-directly" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Admins will never contact you directly</a></li><li><a href="#keep-your-data-secure" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Keep your data secure</a></li><li><a href="#always-check-the-source" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Always check the source</a></li><li><a href="#check-twice-before-sending-dotksm" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Check twice before sending DOT/KSM</a></li><li><a href="#install-the-polkadotjs-extension" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Install the Polkadot{.js} extension</a></li><li><a href="#our-official-sites" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Our official sites</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#i-got-scammed---what-can-i-do" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">I Got Scammed - What Can I Do?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="nav-footer" id="footer"><section class="sitemap"><a href="/" class="nav-home"><img src="/img/Kusama_Canary_white.png" alt="Guide" width="66" height="58"></a><div><a href="https://kusama.network/" target="_blank" class="homepage-font">Kusama Network</a><a href="https://polkadot.network/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="homepage-font">FAQ</a><a href="https://twitter.com/kusamanetwork" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="homepage-font">Twitter</a><a href="https://www.notion.so/web3foundation/Polkadot-Kusama-Community-Hub-ee1fd077ff6c42c381940404f6aa9f1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="homepage-font">Community Hub</a><a href="https://matrix.to/#/!HfRYKXBoPmDBCAWUEJ:polkadot.builders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="homepage-font">Kusama Watercooler</a><a href="https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="homepage-font">Grants and Bounties</a></div><div class="kusama-mainpage-cyber-row"><div class="kusama-mainpage-column"><h2 class="homepage-font-footer">Join a cyber secret society</h2><p class="homepage-font-footer">The Kappa Sigma Mu fraternity asks you to get a Kusama tattoo to join.</p><a href="/docs/maintain-guides-society-kusama"><button class="kusama-mainpage-build-footer">See Kappa Sigma Mu</button></a></div></div></section><section class="row"><div class="copyright homepage-font">© 2022 Web3 Foundation</div><a class="item homepage-font" href="https://polkadot.network/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></section></footer></div>
