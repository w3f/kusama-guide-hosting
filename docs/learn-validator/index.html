Kusama. For more detailed information you
can read the Protocol Overview Section in
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Polkadot Parachain Host Implementers&#x27; Guide</a>.</p></div></div><p>Validators secure the <a href="/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain">relay chain</a> by staking
KSM, validating proofs from collators and
participating in consensus with other validators.</p><p>Validators play a crucial role in adding new blocks to the relay chain and, by extension, to all
parachains. This allows parties to complete cross-chain transactions via the relay chain. Parachain
validators (i.e. para-validators) participate in some form of off-chain consensus, and submit
candidate receipts to the tx pool for a block producer to include on-chain. The relay chain
validators guarantee that each parachain follows its unique rules and can pass messages between
shards in a trust-free environment.</p><p>Para-validators work in groups and are selected in every epoch to validate parachain blocks for all
parachains connected to the relay chain.</p><p>The selected para-validators are one of
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
validators randomly selected (per epoch) to participate in the validation, creating a validator pool
of 200 para-validators.</p><p>Validators perform two main functions:</p><ol><li><strong>Verifying</strong> that the information contained in an assigned set of parachain blocks is valid.
They receive parachain block candidates from the <a href="/docs/learn-collator">collators</a> together with a
Proof-of-Validity (PoV). The para-validators then check if the block candidates are valid.
Candidates that gather enough signed validity statements are considered <em>backable</em>.</li><li><strong>Participating</strong> in the consensus mechanism to produce the relay chain blocks based on validity
statements from other validators. These validators are called block authors, they are selected by
<a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#block-production-babe">BABE</a> and can note up to one backable candidate for
each parachain to include in the relay chain. A backable candidate included in the relay chain is
considered <em>backed</em> in that fork of the chain.</li></ol><p>Validators also contribute to the so-called <strong>availability distribution</strong>. In fact, once the
candidate is backed in a fork of the relay chain, it is still <em>pending availability</em>, i.e. it is not
included as part of the parachain until it is proven avaialable (together with the PoV). Information
regarding the availability of the candidate will be noted in the following relay chain blocks. Only
when there is enough information, the candidate is considered a full parachain block or <em>parablock</em>.</p><p>Validators also participate in the the so-called <a href="#approval-process"><strong>approval process</strong></a>. Once the
parablock is considered available and part of the parachain, it is still <em>pending approval</em>. Because
para-validators are a small subset of all validators, there is a risk that by chance the majority of
para-validators assigned to a parachain might be dishonest. It is thus necessary to run a secondary
verification of the parablock before it can be considered approved. Having a secondary verification
step avoids the allocation of more para-validators that will ultimately reduce the throughput of the
system.</p><p>Any instances of non-compliance with the consensus algorithms result in <a href="#disputes"><strong>disputes</strong></a>
with the punishment of the validators on the wrong side by removing some or all their staked
KSM, thereby discouraging bad actors. Good
performance, however, will be rewarded, with validators receiving block rewards (including
transaction fees) in the form of KSM in exchange
for their activities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="approval-process">Approval Process<a class="hash-link" href="#approval-process" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Having a bad parablock on the relay chain is not catastrophic as long as the block is not approved
and finalized by the finality gadget <a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#finality-gadget-grandpa">GRANDPA</a>. If
the block is not finalized, the fork on the chain containing that block can be ignored in favor of
another fork containing good blocks. Dealing with a bad parablock includes the following stages:</p><ul><li>Detection: the bad block must be detected by honest validators.</li><li>Escalation: the honest validators must send that block for checks to all validators. A dispute
starts.</li><li>Consequences: the chain is reverted and all malicious validators are slashed.</li></ul><p>The result of the dispute must be transplantable to all other forks so that malicious validators are
slashed in all possible histories and so that honest validators will ignore any forks containing
that parablock.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Parablocks vs Relay-Chain blocks</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>It is important to understand that a relay chain block contains many parablocks. Thus, it makes more
sense to think of relay-chain blocks as having been approvead instead of parablocks that have been
approved. A relay-chain block containing a bad parablock must be reverted, while a relay-chain block
containing only approved parablocks can be considered approved as long as its parent relay-chain
block is also approved. Thus, the validity of a relay-chain block depends on the validity of its
ancestry.</p></div></div><p>The Approval Process is divided into two parts:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#assignments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignments</a></strong>
determine which validators perform approval checks on which candidates, ensuring each candidate
receives enough random checkers. This stage tracks approval votes to identify when
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#no-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no-show</a> approval
checks take suspiciously long. It also tracks relay chain
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-avoid-slashing/#equivocation">equivocations</a> to
determine when adversaries possibly gained foreknowledge about assignments and adding more checks
in those cases. Assignees determine their own assignments to check specific candidates using two
or three
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#assignment-criteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assignment criteria</a>,
which are based upon two possible
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a> about the
relay chain block that included the candidate (i.e. declared the candidate available).
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#announcements--notices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignment notices</a>
are gossiped among nodes so that all validators know which validators should check which
candidates, and if any candidate requires more checkers.</li><li><strong>Approval checks</strong> performs the checks by obtaining the candidate, verify its validity, and
sending out the approval vote or initiating a dispute. Approval checks have a no-show timeout
window (i.e. longer than one relay chain slot) to succeed in reconstructing the candidate block,
redo its erasure coding to check the candidate receipt, and recheck the candidate block itself. A
validator becomes tagged as no-show if does not approve or dispute within the no-show timeout
window. Because validators can be overloaded with assignments, they can intentionally delay
sending their assignment notice to avoid creating no-shows (see more in
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#assignment-postponement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignment postponement</a>).</li></ul><p>These two steps first run as off-chain consensus protocols using messages gossiped among all
validators, and then as on-chain record of those protocols&#x27; progress. The on-chain protocol is
needed to provide rewards for the off-chain protocol. The
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#on-chain-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on-chain verification</a>
has two phases: a) assignments notices and approval votes are recorded in a relay chain block, and
b) in another relay chain block notes are fed into the approval code.</p><p>The gossiped messages are of two types, assignment notices and approval votes, and are singed with
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-approval.html#approval-keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval keys</a>.
Such keys are part of the <a href="/docs/learn-cryptography/#session-keys">session keys</a> used by validators.
Briefly, approval keys are:</p><ul><li><strong>Approval assignment keys</strong> that are sr25519 keys used only for assignment criteria
<a href="/docs/learn-randomness/#vrf">VRF</a>.</li><li><strong>Approval vote keys</strong> that are ed25519 and would only sign off on a candidate parablock validity.</li></ul><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>For detailed information about the approval process see dedicated section in

dispute, or having passed through and escalation/dispute stage with a positive outcome.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="disputes">Disputes<a class="hash-link" href="#disputes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>All parachain blocks that are in the finalized relay chain should be valid. This, does not apply to
backed blocks that are not included. To ensure nothing invalid ends up in the finalized relay chain
there are approval checks (described above) and disputes. The latter ensures that each attempt to
include something invalid is caught and the offending validators are punished.</p><p>Disputes are <em>independent from a particular fork</em>, while backing and approval operate on particular
forks. The approval voting stops if an alternative fork (which might not contain the
currently-approved candidate) is finalized. In fact, the sole purpose of the approval process is to
make sure invalid blocks are not finalized. However, even though the danger is past and the
offending validators did not manage to get the invalid block approved, those validators need to get
slashed for the attempt.</p><p>A dispute stems from a disagreement between two or more validators. For this to happen, a bad actor
needs to distribute an invalid block to honest validators. Scenarios leading to a dispute can be one
of the followings (ordered from most to least important):</p><ul><li>A parablock included on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li><li>A parablock backed on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li><li>A parablock seconded, but not backed on any branch of the relay chain, is bad</li></ul><p>Checking a parachain block requires 3 pieces of data: the parachain validator code, the availability
of data, and the candidate receipt. The validator code is available on-chain and published ahead of
time. Thus, a dispute process begins with the availability to ensure the availability of the data.
Such process will conclude quickly if the data is already available, otherwise the initiator of the
dispute must make it available.</p><p>Disputes have both off- and on-chain components. Slashing is handled on-chain, so votes by
validators on either sides of the dispute must be placed on-chain. Moreover, a dispute on one branch
of the chain must be transposed to all active branches so that misbehavior can be punished in all
possible histories. There is thus a distinction between <em>local</em> (the one we are looking at) and
<em>remote</em> disputes relative to a particular branch of the relay chain.</p><p>Disputes can be divided into three different phases:</p><ul><li><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-disputes.html#initiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispute initiation</a>:
Disputes are initiated by any validator who finds their opinion on the validity of a parablock in
opposition to another issued statement. The initiation begins off-chain by only nodes perceiving
that a parablock is bad. The validator can be one of the para-validators (i.e. one of the backers)
or one of the approval checkers. Note that, if the dispute occurs during the backing phase, the
initiator must make the data available while if the dispute occurs during the approval process the
data is already available.</li><li><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-disputes.html#dispute-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispute participation</a>:
Once becoming aware of the dispute, all validators must participate.</li><li><a href="https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot/book/protocol-disputes.html#dispute-conclusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispute conclusion</a>:
Disputes conclude after 2/3 supermajority is reached on either side. Disputes may also conclude
after a timeout. This will only happen if the majority of validators are unable to vote for some
reason.</li></ul><p>The on-chain component of the dispute can be initiated by providing any two conflicting votes and it
also waits for 2/3 supermajority on either side. The component also tracks which parablocks have
already been disputed so that the same parablock can be disputed only once on any particular branch
of the relay chain. Inclusion is halted for the parachain until the dispute resolves.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>For detailed information about disputes see dedicated section in
