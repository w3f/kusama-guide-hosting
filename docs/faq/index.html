of Authority (PoA) network, with governance controlled by the single Sudo (super-user) account.
During this time, validators started joining the network and signaling their intention to
participate in consensus.</p><p>The network evolved to become a Proof of Stake (PoS) network on June 18, 2020. With the chain
secured by the decentralized community of validators, the Sudo module was removed on July 20, 2020,
transitioning the governance of the chain into the hands of the token (DOT) holders. This is the
point where Polkadot became decentralized.</p><p>The final step of the transition to full-functioning Polkadot was the enabling of transfer
functionality, which occurred on Polkadot at block number 1_205_128 on August 18, 2020, at 16:39
UTC.</p><p>On August 21, 2020, Redenomination of DOT occurred. From this date, one DOT (old) equals 100 new
DOT.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="polkadot-roadmap">Polkadot Roadmap<a href="#polkadot-roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Polkadot Roadmap" title="Direct link to Polkadot Roadmap">â€‹</a></h2><p>For more information on the Polkadot roadmap please visit the
<a href="https://polkadot.network/technology/#roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Polkadot website</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="validators">Validators<a href="#validators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Validators" title="Direct link to Validators">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-apply-to-be-a-validator">How do I apply to be a validator?<a href="#how-do-i-apply-to-be-a-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do I apply to be a validator?" title="Direct link to How do I apply to be a validator?">â€‹</a></h3><p>There is no central authority that decides on validators, so there is not per se an <em>application</em>
that you can fill out. Registering as a validator is permissionless; in order to become one you must
only set up a validator node and mark your intention to validate on chain. For detailed instruction
on how to do this you can consult the
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama">Kusama validator guide</a> on validating
for Kusama or the
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot">Polkadot validator guide</a> for validating
on Polkadot.</p><p>However, once you&#x27;ve set up a validator and have registered your intention it does not mean that you
will be included in the <em>active set</em> right away. The validators are elected to the active set based
on the results of an election algorithm known as <a href="/docs/learn-phragmen">PhragmÃ©n&#x27;s method</a>.
PhragmÃ©n&#x27;s method tries to accomplish two goals: 1) select <code>n</code> members from a larger set based on
stake-weighted votes and 2) equalize the stake backing each validator as much as possible.</p><p>You will likely want to campaign your validator to the community in order to get more backing. You
are looking for <em>nominators</em> that will put up their tokens to increase the stake for your validator.
For validators who cannot acquire the minimum stake from the community, Parity and Web3 Foundation
also run a joint program called <a href="/docs/thousand-validators">Thousand Validators</a> that will nominate
validators if they apply and fit the requirements.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-are-validators-rewarded">How are validators rewarded?<a href="#how-are-validators-rewarded" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How are validators rewarded?" title="Direct link to How are validators rewarded?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Validators are rewarded from the inflation of the Relay Chain, transaction fees, and tips. However,
they only take a percentage of the former two. More details can be read on the page for
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout">validator payouts</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-minimum-stake-necessary-to-be-elected-as-an-active-validator">What is the minimum stake necessary to be elected as an active validator?<a href="#what-is-the-minimum-stake-necessary-to-be-elected-as-an-active-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the minimum stake necessary to be elected as an active validator?" title="Direct link to What is the minimum stake necessary to be elected as an active validator?">â€‹</a></h3><p>The minimum stake that is necessary to be elected as an active validator is dynamic and can change
over time. It depends not only on how much stake is being put behind each validator, but also the
size of the active set and how many validators are waiting in the pool.</p><p>There are a few ways to estimate the minimum stake.</p><p>One way can be to navigate to the
<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/polkadot.dotapps.io/#/staking/targets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot Apps Targets tab</a>. The value
at the top of the screen saying &quot;Lowest&quot; is the least staked validator. You need at least this
much + 1 to enter the set.</p><p>You can also use some tools some to perform estimations.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-debug-kit/tree/master/offline-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Offline Election</a>
can provide exact results of running an election on the current set of validators using the same
Rust code that is ran in Polkadot.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/w3f/validator-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Validator stats script</a> can give you an estimate that is
based on the currently elected set, as well as some statistics about Kusama validators.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-will-polkadot-have-only-1000-validators-while-other-projects-have-hundreds-of-thousands">Why will Polkadot have only 1000 validators while other projects have hundreds of thousands?<a href="#why-will-polkadot-have-only-1000-validators-while-other-projects-have-hundreds-of-thousands" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why will Polkadot have only 1000 validators while other projects have hundreds of thousands?" title="Direct link to Why will Polkadot have only 1000 validators while other projects have hundreds of thousands?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Polkadot&#x27;s goal to have 1000 validators is set to be something that is practically achievable in the
short term with high confidence of good performance in a live environment. Furthermore, validators
in Polkadot are not the only stakers, and if we consider the number of stakers that can be possible
on Polkadot the number can scale up to hundreds of thousands. Since validators are performing
critical consensus work to maintain the security of the chain including all of its shards, a more
modest number of validators is estimated to start. Upon later improvements, such as implementing
signature aggregation for finalization messages, the number of validators could reasonably scale up.
However, increasing validators above one thousand remains a goal for later iterations of Polkadot.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that one thousand validators is more than the number of validators of
similar PoS chains with comparable levels of economic security as Polkadot. The closest contenders
are operating with around 150 validators, while Polkadot is already securely running with
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
validators.</p><p>Additionally, other projects sometimes have a different definition of <em>validator</em> that approximates
more closely to remote signing keys without the full operation of a validating node. On Polkadot,
each validator is running their own validating node and performing full verification of the Relay
Chain, voting on finality, producing blocks in their decided slots, and verifying parachain state
transitions. Other projects may consider validators and &quot;validating nodes&quot; as separate entities.</p><p>Finally, individuals may participate in the block production process indirectly by
<a href="/docs/learn-nominator">nominating</a> validators. In this way, individuals who are not running a
node can still share in staking rewards.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="relay-chain">Relay Chain<a href="#relay-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Relay Chain" title="Direct link to Relay Chain">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-block-time-of-the-relay-chain">What is the block time of the Relay Chain?<a href="#what-is-the-block-time-of-the-relay-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the block time of the Relay Chain?" title="Direct link to What is the block time of the Relay Chain?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Both the Kusama and Polkadot networks are currently operating at a rate of one block every six
seconds.</p><p>This may be changed in the future. It may go as low as two to three seconds after optimizations, or
potentially increase in order to handle the capacity of the parachain networking in a live
environment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="does-polkadot-have-smart-contracts">Does Polkadot have smart contracts?<a href="#does-polkadot-have-smart-contracts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Does Polkadot have smart contracts?" title="Direct link to Does Polkadot have smart contracts?">â€‹</a></h3><p>No - and yes. The Polkadot Relay Chain does not implement smart contracts natively. The reason for
not having smart contracts on the Relay Chain is part of the design philosophy for Polkadot that
dictates that the Relay Chain should be the minimal logic required to accomplish its job.</p><p>However, Polkadot will be a platform for other chains that <em>do</em> implement smart contracts. It&#x27;s
possible for parachains to enable smart contract functionality and then benefit from the security
and interoperability features of Polkadot. Additionally, existing smart contract chains can connect
to Polkadot as a parachain, or via a bridge.</p><p>While the Polkadot Relay Chain does not implement smart contracts directly, undoubtedly there will
be parachains that do. So it&#x27;s better to say that the Polkadot <em>ecosystem</em> has smart contracts
versus &quot;Polkadot has smart contracts.&quot;</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-will-the-polkadot-relay-chain-connect-to-external-chains-in-the-ecosystem">How will the Polkadot Relay Chain connect to external chains in the ecosystem?<a href="#how-will-the-polkadot-relay-chain-connect-to-external-chains-in-the-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How will the Polkadot Relay Chain connect to external chains in the ecosystem?" title="Direct link to How will the Polkadot Relay Chain connect to external chains in the ecosystem?">â€‹</a></h3><p>One of the cornerstone interoperability technologies being researched and developed for deployment
on Polkadot is cross-chain bridges. Bridges come in a variety of flavors with varying levels of
trust associated with them. Polkadot is predominantly researching the trust-minimized flavor that
imposes economic costs on the operators of the bridge, and therefore makes it economically secure.
Bridge efforts are being worked on in concert with other projects in the ecosystem. Eventually,
there will be bridges between Polkadot and most of the other major chains.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-polkadots-transactions-per-second-tps">What is Polkadot&#x27;s Transactions Per Second (TPS)?<a href="#what-is-polkadots-transactions-per-second-tps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Polkadot&#x27;s Transactions Per Second (TPS)?" title="Direct link to What is Polkadot&#x27;s Transactions Per Second (TPS)?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Polkadot is a heterogeneous sharded network comprising a relay chain and numerous parachains, which
are all individual blockchains built on <a href="https://substrate.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Substrate</a> executing in parallel.
Hence, the Transactions Per Second (TPS) of Polkadot is a number that encompasses all the
transactions on the relay chain as well as parachains. As the transactions on these Substrate-based
blockchains are <a href="https://docs.substrate.io/build/tx-weights-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weights based</a>, it makes sense to
use TPS as a measure for the network performance if all the transactions carry the same weight.
<a href="https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/1270025498580656134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance benchmark tests</a> show that
Substrate-based blockchains can achieve over 1000 TPS for balance transfer transactions. Assuming
Polkadot is running over 100 parachains; the projected TPS is well over 100,000. With
<a href="/docs/learn-async-backing">asynchronous backing upgrade</a>, the TPS is expected to increase
tenfold to 1,000,000.</p><p>It is essential to realize that TPS is inherently a subjective measurement with numerous factors
that can contribute to it. It&#x27;s hard to gauge the usefulness of TPS in isolation (when compared to
other chains), as it depends on what a transaction does for a particular network. To view how
Polkadot measures TPS see the Polkadot sTPS
(<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-stps/blob/main/docs/introduction.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Standard Transaction Per Second</a>)
to consider precisely how benchmarking was performed for Polkadot.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dot">DOT<a href="#dot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DOT" title="Direct link to DOT">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-difference-between-dot-old-and-new-dot">What is the difference between DOT (old) and new DOT?<a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-dot-old-and-new-dot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the difference between DOT (old) and new DOT?" title="Direct link to What is the difference between DOT (old) and new DOT?">â€‹</a></h3><p>The DOT (old) unit on Polkadot was at twelve decimal places, otherwise known as 1e12 Plancks. On 21
August, 2020, Denomination Day, the DOT (old) value was redenominated to 1e10 (10_000_000_000, or
ten billion) Plancks, meaning that the new DOT was valued at ten decimal places. Following the
<a href="/docs/learn-redenomination">redenomination</a>, the new DOT is called DOT.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-inflation-rate-of-the-dot">What is the inflation rate of the DOT?<a href="#what-is-the-inflation-rate-of-the-dot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the inflation rate of the DOT?" title="Direct link to What is the inflation rate of the DOT?">â€‹</a></h3><p>The inflation rate is approximately 10% per year.</p><p>A portion of the inflation is rewarded to validators for performing their duties, while another
portion may go directly to the treasury. The exact percentage that goes into both varies and is
based on the amount of DOT that are staked. Please see the article on
<a href="/docs/learn-staking/#inflation">inflation</a> for more information.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-cant-crowdloaned-dot-be-staked">Why can&#x27;t crowdloaned DOT be staked?<a href="#why-cant-crowdloaned-dot-be-staked" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why can&#x27;t crowdloaned DOT be staked?" title="Direct link to Why can&#x27;t crowdloaned DOT be staked?">â€‹</a></h3><p>DOTs contributed to a successful crowdloan campaign by a parachain are bonded for the entire lease
period, which is two years on Polkadot. The crowdloaned DOT cannot be used for any other DOT utility
functionalities like staking and democracy. In exchange to the lost staking rewards or liquidity of
DOTs, the parachain team may offer rewards to the contributor.</p><p>The utility of crowdloaned DOT is to provide a lease for a parachain. The utility of staked DOT is
to secure the network through a reward/slash mechanism. Allowing crowdloaned DOT to be staked
results in complex consequences like applying a slash on crowdloaned DOT that was meant to be bonded
for the entire lease period of a parachain. In a way, the inaccessibility of crowdloaned DOTs and
the lack of staking rewards for the entire lease duration encourages the contributors to back
projects that are valuable to the ecosystem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance">Governance<a href="#governance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Governance" title="Direct link to Governance">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-prevents-polkadot-governance-from-failing">What prevents Polkadot governance from failing?<a href="#what-prevents-polkadot-governance-from-failing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What prevents Polkadot governance from failing?" title="Direct link to What prevents Polkadot governance from failing?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Polkadot&#x27;s governance has already been shown to work. Examples can be found in the runtime upgrades
that have successfully taken place through on the testnets as well as in a real economic environment
on <a href="https://guide.kusama.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kusama</a> and Polkadot itself.</p><p>It is fair to say that the field of on-chain blockchain governance is still new, and no one can
claim to know exactly what the optimal version of on-chain governance is yet. However, Polkadot
takes a brave step forward in pioneering thought-through mechanisms for evolving a blockchain.</p><p>Blockchains need a method to adapt and evolve. Therefore, an on-chain governance system was
necessary for the long-term success of Polkadot. Ultimately, it is the token holders that are
responsible for preventing Polkadot&#x27;s governance from failing by using their economic value and
conviction to sway the progression of the protocol.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-prevents-polkadot-governance-from-becoming-plutocratic">What prevents Polkadot governance from becoming plutocratic?<a href="#what-prevents-polkadot-governance-from-becoming-plutocratic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What prevents Polkadot governance from becoming plutocratic?" title="Direct link to What prevents Polkadot governance from becoming plutocratic?">â€‹</a></h3><p>A savvy reader might have noticed that the answer to the previous question endowed the token holder
with the ultimate responsibility to ensure that Polkadot&#x27;s governance does not fail. By following
the train of this assertion, one might assume that Polkadot&#x27;s governance is susceptible to becoming
ruled by a few large token holders (called <em>whales</em> in trading parlance) and therefore become a mere
plutocracy (rule of the rich).</p><p>There are several other mechanisms that are built-in to the governance system to resist this
plutocratic tendency. One of these mechanisms is called conviction voting, and imbues greater voting
power to token holders who are willing to lock their tokens on the protocol for longer lengths of
time. Longer lock-ups display <em>conviction</em> in a vote. Conviction voting could allow a highly
determined minority to overrule the vote of an apathetic majority in certain situations. Another
mechanism is known as Adaptive Quorum Biasing. This makes proposals have a varying threshold for
approval or rejection based on what part of the governance protocol the proposal originated in. For
details on the subtleties of Polkadot&#x27;s governance system, please see the
<a href="/docs/learn-governance">governance page</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="parachains">Parachains<a href="#parachains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Parachains" title="Direct link to Parachains">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-parachain-economics-work">How do parachain economics work?<a href="#how-do-parachain-economics-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do parachain economics work?" title="Direct link to How do parachain economics work?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Parachains have the flexibility to implement their own monetary system or incentive structure for
collators. However, this is not strictly necessary. Since the collator&#x27;s job is to continue to give
recent state transitions to the validators on the Relay Chain who validate each transition, the
security of the parachain and the Polkadot network is completely separate from parachain economics.
Parachains need collators to continue to progress, so it wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable to see them
incentivize collator nodes in some way, but the specific mechanism is completely up to parachain
implementers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-parachains-ephemeral-what-happens-when-a-parachain-loses-the-next-auction">Are parachains ephemeral?

What happens when a parachain loses the next auction?" title="Direct link to Are parachains ephemeral? What happens when a parachain loses the next auction?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Parachains are not ephemeral. As long as someone is keeping the data for a parachain, the parachain
can move between being a parachain, a parathread, or a separate sovereign chain at different points
of its lifetime. Especially with parathreads, parachains can be decommissioned to only produce
blocks when their usage and throughput makes it necessary.</p><p>When a parachain loses an auction for renewal, that parachain has a few options. In most cases,
becoming a parathread instead would be a suitable choice. Parathreads are still secured by the Relay
Chain, but don&#x27;t need to hold a parachain slot and can produce a block when its economically
feasible for them. For more on parachains please see the
<a href="/docs/learn-parachains">parachains page</a> and for more on parathreads see

Substrate, and many other projects. It is a collection of peer-to-peer protocols for finding peers
and connecting to them. Its modules have logic for content routing, peer routing, peer discovery,
different transports, and NAT traversals. It is intended to be used by applications for building
large scale peer-to-peer networks by only selecting the parts of the protocol suite that are needed.</p><p>The Rust implementation of the specification was built and primarily maintained by a team of
contributors at Parity Technologies. The Go and JavaScript versions are maintained by Protocol Labs
as well as community contributors. A <a href="https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nim</a> version of the
library also exists. Libp2p as a whole is an open source project that is actively developed and
expanded on various code repositories hosted on <a href="https://github.com/libp2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their GitHub</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="does-polkadot-use-libp2p">Does Polkadot use libp2p?<a href="#does-polkadot-use-libp2p" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Does Polkadot use libp2p?" title="Direct link to Does Polkadot use libp2p?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Yes, since Polkadot is built with Substrate. Substrate uses a networking protocol that is based on
libp2p (specifically the Rust libp2p library). However, Substrate uses a mix of standard libp2p
protocols and protocols that are homegrown and not official libp2p standards. Of the standards
protocols, those which are shared with other implementations of libp2p such as IPFS, are
connection-checking (ping), asking for information on a peer (identity), and Kademlia random walks
(kad).</p><p>Of the protocols that are custom to Substrate, there are the legacy Substrate stream, a
request-response for getting information on blocks (sync), a light client protocol, a notification
protocol for transactions, and block announcement. For detailed information on how Substrate uses
libp2p and the standard and custom protocols, please see the
<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_network/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">networking documentation</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-libp2p-differ-from-ipfs">How does libp2p differ from IPFS?<a href="#how-does-libp2p-differ-from-ipfs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does libp2p differ from IPFS?" title="Direct link to How does libp2p differ from IPFS?">â€‹</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interplanetary File System</a> (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol used
primarily for storage of files. It allows one to upload a file onto the network and share it with
its content addressable URI. IPFS, like Substrate, is an application of libp2p and exists higher on
the technology stack. Although both IPFS and Substrate use libp2p, it cannot be said that Substrate
&quot;uses&quot; IPFS since besides sharing the underlying library for networking there is no native
integration between the two applications.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kusama">Kusama<a href="#kusama" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kusama" title="Direct link to Kusama">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-minimum-amount-of-ksm--dot-i-can-have-in-my-account">What is the minimum amount of KSM / DOT I can have in my account?<a href="#what-is-the-minimum-amount-of-ksm--dot-i-can-have-in-my-account" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the minimum amount of KSM / DOT I can have in my account?" title="Direct link to What is the minimum amount of KSM / DOT I can have in my account?">â€‹</a></h3><p>Please see information about <a href="/docs/build-protocol-info">Existential Deposits</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-transfer-fees-for-kusama">What are the transfer fees for Kusama?<a href="#what-are-the-transfer-fees-for-kusama" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the transfer fees for Kusama?" title="Direct link to What are the transfer fees for Kusama?">â€‹</a></h3><p>It is important to note that the cost of transferring KSM is dynamic.
