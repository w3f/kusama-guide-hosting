in Polkadot and Kusama. The other two bodies are the
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-join-council">council</a> and the
<a href="/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee">technical committee</a>.</p><p>Public referenda can be proposed and voted on by any token holder in the system as long as they
provide a bond. After a proposal is made, others can agree with it by <em>endorsing</em> it and putting up
tokens equal to the original bond. During every launch period, the most endorsed proposal will be
moved to the public referenda table where it can be voted upon. Voters who are willing to lock up
their tokens for a greater duration of time can do so and get their votes amplified. For more
details on the governance system please see <a href="/docs/learn-governance">here</a>.</p><p>This guide will instruct token holders how to propose and vote on public referenda using the
Democracy module. Below are a few links to stay informed and directly engage with the community.</p><ul><li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#polkadot-direction:matrix.parity.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot Direction</a> - a place to

being approved and enacted.</p><p><strong>Cooloff Period</strong> - The period in blocks where a proposal may not be re-submitted after being
vetoed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proposing-an-action">Proposing an Action<a class="hash-link" href="#proposing-an-action" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Proposing an action to be taken requires you to bond some tokens. In order to ensure you have enough
tokens to make the minimum deposit, you can check the parameter in the chain state. Navigate to
Developer &gt; Chain State &gt; Constants &gt; selected constant query: democracy &gt; minimumDeposit: u128 and
then click on the plus button. The bonded tokens will only be released once the proposal is tabled
(that is, brought to a vote); there is no way for the user to &quot;revoke&quot; their proposal and get the
bond back before it has become a referendum. Since it is essentially impossible to predict
definitely when a proposal may become a referendum (if ever), this means that any tokens bonded will
be locked for an indeterminate amount of time.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Proposals cannot be revoked by the proposer, even if they never turn into a referendum</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>It is important to realize that there is no guarantee that DOT you use for proposing or endorsing a

hash is simply the hash of the proposal to be enacted. The easiest way to get the preimage hash is
by clicking on the &quot;Submit preimage&quot; button and configuring the action that you are proposing.</p><p>The example below demonstrates the creation of a proposal on Kusama (<strong>the same procedure applies to
Polkadot</strong>). If you wanted to propose that a remark &quot;Expect Chaos!&quot; is added, the preimage hash
would be <code>0x8ac3f722caf7677254e25ca4ad77d533ca893c7d2ad4009e258d749f2004ef94</code>. You can copy this
preimage hash and save it for the next step. There is no need to click Submit Preimage at this
point, though you could. We&#x27;ll go over that in the next section.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="submit preimage" src="/assets/images/submit_preimage-b0165c4aa5615a416bc1698ff21cba2e.png" width="1182" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now you will click on the &quot;Submit proposal&quot; button and enter the preimage hash in the input titled
&quot;preimage hash&quot; and <em>at least</em> the minimum deposit into the &quot;locked balance&quot; field. Click on the
&quot;Submit proposal&quot; button and confirm the transaction. You should now see your proposal appear in the
&quot;proposals&quot; column on the page.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="submit proposal" src="/assets/images/submit_proposal-24cc24bb4fdb502da80a28082f779da8.png" width="1184" height="456" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now your proposal is visible to anyone who accesses the chain and others can endorse it or submit a
preimage. However, it&#x27;s hard to tell what exactly this proposal does since it shows the hash of the
action. Other holders will not be able to make a judgement on whether they endorse it or not until
someone submits the actual preimage for this proposal. In the next step, you will submit the
preimage.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="proposal hash" src="/assets/images/proposal-hash-1ae67063393c7e77001e538b9d4a67af.png" width="1424" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="submitting-a-preimage">Submitting a Preimage<a class="hash-link" href="#submitting-a-preimage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The act of making a proposal is split from submitting the preimage for the proposal since the
storage cost of submitting a large preimage could be pretty expensive. Allowing for the preimage
submission to come as a separate transaction means that another account could submit the preimage
for you if you don&#x27;t have the funds to do so. It also means that you don&#x27;t have to pay so many funds
right away as you can prove the preimage hash out-of-band.</p><p>However, at some point before the proposal passes you will need to submit the preimage or else the
proposal cannot be enacted. The guide will now show you how to do this.</p><p>Click on the blue &quot;Submit preimage&quot; button and configure it to be the same as what you did before to
acquire the preimage hash. This time, instead of copying the hash to another tab, you will follow
through and click &quot;Submit preimage&quot; and confirm the transaction.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="submit preimage" src="/assets/images/submit_preimage-b0165c4aa5615a416bc1698ff21cba2e.png" width="1182" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once the transaction is included you should see the UI update with the information for your already
submitted proposal.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="proposals" src="/assets/images/proposals-9b3cc3a8bd2ff1c01c0dbc7c90950d3f.png" width="1424" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="endorsing-a-proposal">Endorsing a Proposal<a class="hash-link" href="#endorsing-a-proposal" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Endorsing a proposal means that you are agreeing with the proposal and backing it with an equal
amount of deposit as was originally locked. The bonded tokens will be released once the proposal is
tabled (that is, brought to a vote), just like the original proposer&#x27;s bond. By endorsing a proposal
you will move it higher up the rank of proposals. The most endorsed proposal <!-- -->—<!-- --> in value, not
the number of supporters <!-- -->—<!-- --> will be brought to a referendum every launch period.</p><p>It is important to note that there is no way to stop or cancel endorsing a proposal once it has been
done. Therefore, the DOT that was endorsed will be reserved until the proposal is tabled as a
referendum. This is an indeterminate amount of time, since there is no guarantee that a proposal
will become a referendum for a given period, as other proposals may be proposed and tabled before
it.</p><p>Note that it is possible for a single account to endorse a proposal multiple times. This is by
design; it is the value, not the number of endorsements <em>per se</em>, that counts in terms of weighting.
If there were a limit of one endorsement per account, it would be trivial for a user with, for
example, 1000 DOT to create ten accounts with 100 DOT instead of a single account with 1000 DOT.
Thus, no restrictions are made on the number of times a single account can endorse a proposal.</p><p>To endorse a proposal, navigate to the proposal you want to endorse and click on the &quot;Endorse&quot;
button.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="endorsement button" src="/assets/images/endorse1-6f9ed6c3eb99cad52bd07e250307b397.png" width="1440" height="128" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You will be prompted with the full details of the proposal (if the preimage has been submitted!) and
can then broadcast the transaction by clicking the blue &quot;Endorse&quot; button.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="endorsement confirmed" src="/assets/images/endorse-7e22987ceebef0c1ce17f475510eacc9.png" width="1184" height="356" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once successful, you will see your endorsement appear in the dropdown in the proposal details.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="endorsement result" src="/assets/images/endorsed-list-460b771aedaf6e91f9caaaf728d76dfd.png" width="1440" height="336" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="voting-on-a-proposal">Voting on a Proposal<a class="hash-link" href="#voting-on-a-proposal" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>At the end of each launch period, the most endorsed proposal will move to a referendum. During this
time you can cast a vote for or against the proposal. You may also lock up your tokens for a greater
length of time to weigh your vote more strongly. During the time your tokens are locked, you are
unable to transfer them, however they can still be used for further votes. Locks are layered on top
of each other, so an eight-week lock does not become a 15-week lock if you vote again a week later,
rather another eight-week lock is placed to extend the lock just one extra week.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Voting and staking locks can overlap</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><ul><li>A user can use staked funds to vote on referenda (and/or to vote for Councillors).</li><li>A user is only prohibited from transferring these funds to another account.</li></ul></div></div><p>To vote on a referendum, navigate to the

lock your tokens, the stronger your vote will be weighted. The timeline for the conviction starts
after the voting period ends; tokens used for voting will always be locked until the end of the
voting period, no matter what conviction you vote with. Unwillingness to lock your tokens means that
your vote only counts for 10% of the tokens that you hold, while the maximum lock-up of 896 days
means you can make your vote count for 600% of the tokens that you hold. It is possible to vote with
tokens already locked by staking.</p><p>When you are comfortable with the decision you have made, click the blue &quot;Vote&quot; button to submit
your transaction and wait for it to be included in a block.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="voting" src="/assets/images/voting-4abb1178436833648da30b63d860aa10.png" width="940" height="712" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unlocking-locked-tokens">Unlocking Locked Tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#unlocking-locked-tokens" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Like <a href="/docs/learn-DOT#lazy-vesting">vesting</a>, the tokens that are locked in democracy are
unlocked lazily. This means that you, the user, must explicitly call an unlock extrinsic to make
your funds available again after the lock expires. Unbonding is another term you hear a lot in
Polkadot, it means withdrawing your DOT that was used in staking. To know more about it, please see
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-unbond">here</a>.</p><p>You can do this from the &quot;Accounts&quot; page in
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>, unless you use Ledger (see below).
First, check that your account has a &quot;democracy&quot; lock by opening the details on your balance. In the
example below the account has 150 KSM locked in democracy.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="democracy balance details" src="/assets/images/democracy_balance_details-56b5c71fe66fc4a0d66ba4820a3cc6a9.png" width="342" height="214" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now you can click the menu button (the three dots) and find the option that says &quot;Clear expired

Or, if you are using the Ledger hardware wallet, you will not be able to issue the batch Unlock

following extrinsic: <code>democracy.removeVote(index)</code> using the account that you voted with. For the

vote to another account whose opinion you trust. When you delegate to another account, that account
gets the added voting power of your tokens along with the conviction that you set. The conviction
for delegation works just like the conviction for regular voting, except your tokens may be locked
longer than they would normally since locking resets when you undelegate your vote.</p><p>The account that is being delegated to does not make any special action once the delegation is in
place. They can continue to vote on referenda how they see fit. The difference is now when the
Democracy system tallies votes, the delegated tokens now are added to whatever vote the delegatee
has made.</p><p>You can delegate your vote to another account and even attach a &quot;Conviction&quot; to the delegation.
Navigate to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Accounts&quot; tab on Polkadot-JS UI</a> and
click on the three vertical dots and select &quot;Delegate democracy votes&quot; option for the account of
your choice. Then you would be presented with a pop-up window which lets you enter the account
details of the delegated account, delegated amount and conviction. You can enter the relevant
details and click on the delegate button and then sign and submit the transaction.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="delegate" src="/assets/images/delegate-vote-a8b4d534e0e004f8d0d4a32a45f3a77a.png" width="1880" height="724" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Your delegation will count toward whatever account you delegated for votes on until you explicitly
undelegate your vote.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Query the chain state for an account&#x27;s delegation preferences</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>It is possible to query the delegation preferences of any actively delegating account on the network

In this
case, your tokens will be locked for the maximum amount of time in accordance with the conviction
you set at the beginning of the delegation. For example, if you chose &quot;2x&quot; delegation for four weeks
of lock-up time, your tokens will be locked for 4 weeks after sending the <code>undelegate</code> transaction.
Once your vote has been undelegated, you are in control of making votes with it once again. You can
start to vote directly, or choose a different account to act as your delegate.</p><p>The <code>undelegate</code> transaction must be sent from the account that you wish to clear of its delegation.
For example, if Alice has delegated her tokens to Bob, Alice would need to be the one to call the
<code>undelegate</code> transaction to clear her delegation.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is from the
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Accounts&quot; tab on Polkadot-JS UI</a> where you can manage the
delegation of your account.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="manage delegation" src="/assets/images/manage-delegation-19501197d96e688a08f257a1443f18cd.png" width="1990" height="224" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When you click on &quot;manage delegation&quot;, you would be presented with a pre-populated pop-up window
