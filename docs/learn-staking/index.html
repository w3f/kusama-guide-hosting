Kusama.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proof-of-stake-pos">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)<a href="#proof-of-stake-pos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)" title="Direct link to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)">â€‹</a></h2><p>Blockchain networks use <a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#why-do-we-need-consensus">consensus</a> mechanisms to
finalize blocks on the chain. Consensus is the process of agreeing on something, in this case, the
progression of the blockchain or how blocks are added to the chain. Consensus consists of two
actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Block production</strong>, i.e. the way multiple blocks candidates are produced, and</li><li><strong>Block finality</strong>, i.e. the way only one block out of many candidates is selected and added to
the canonical chain (see <a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#probabilistic-vs-provable-finality">this</a> article
for more information about finality).</li></ul><p>Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) are well-known mechanisms used to reach consensus in a
secure and trustless way on public blockchains, where there are many participants who do not know
each other (and probably never will). In PoW, network security relies on the fact that the miners
who are responsible for adding blocks to the chain must compete to solve difficult mathematic
puzzles to add blocks - a solution that has been criticized for the wastage of energy. For doing
this work, miners are typically rewarded with tokens.</p><p>In PoS networks like Kusama the security of
the network depends on the amount of capital locked on the chain: the more the capital locked, the
lower the chance of an attack on the network, as the attacker needs to incur a heavy loss to
orchestrate a successful attack (more on this later on). The process of locking tokens on the chain
is called <strong>staking</strong>.</p><p>Similar to the miners in PoW networks, PoS networks have <strong>validators</strong>, but they do not have to
compete with each other to solve mathematical puzzles. They are instead pre-selected to produce the
blocks based on the stake backing them. Token holders can lock funds on the chain and for doing so,
they are getting <strong>staking rewards</strong>. There is thus an economic incentive for token holders to
become active participants who contribute to the economic security and stability of the network. PoS
networks in general are therefore more inclusive than PoW networks, as participants do not need to
have either technical knowledge about blockchain technology or experience in running mining
equipment.</p><p>PoS ensures that everybody participating in the staking process has &quot;skin in the game&quot; and thus can
be held accountable. In case of misbehavior, participants in the staking process can be punished or
<strong>slashed</strong>, and depending on the gravity of the situation, their stake can be partly or fully
confiscated by the network. It is not in a staker&#x27;s economic interest to orchestrate an attack and
risk losing tokens. Any rational actor staking on the network would want to get rewarded, and the
PoS network rewards good behavior and punishes bad behavior.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nominated-proof-of-stake-npos">Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)<a href="#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)" title="Direct link to Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)">â€‹</a></h2><p>Kusama implements
<a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#nominated-proof-of-stake">Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)</a>, a relatively novel
and sophisticated mechanism to select the validators who are allowed to participate in its
<a href="/docs/learn-consensus">consensus</a> protocol. NPoS encourages
KSM holders to participate as <strong>nominators</strong>.</p><p>Any potential validators can indicate their intention to be a validator candidate. Their candidacies
are made public to all nominators, and a nominator, in turn, submits a list of up to
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
candidates that it supports, and the network will automatically distribute the stake among
validators in an even manner so that the economic security is maximized. In the next era, a certain
number of validators having the most KSM backing
get elected and become active. For more information about the election algorithm go to
<a href="/docs/learn-phragmen">this</a> page on the wiki or
<a href="https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/protocols/NPoS/Paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> research article. As a
nominator, a minimum of
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
is required to submit an intention to nominate, which can be thought of as registering to be a
nominator. Note that in NPoS the stake of both nominators and validators can be slashed. For an
in-depth review of NPoS see

The
action of locking tokens is also known as <strong>bonding</strong>. You can also refer to your locked tokens as
your bonded tokens, or staked tokens. Likewise, selecting validators is also known as backing or
nominating validators. These terms are used interchangeably by the community. From now on locked
tokens will be referred to as bonded tokens.</p><p>Once the previous 2 steps are completed and you are nominating, your bonded tokens could be
allocated to one or more of your selected validators, and this happens every time the active
validator set changes. This validator set is updated every era on
Kusama.</p><p>Unlike other staking systems, Kusama
automatically chooses which of your selected validators will be backed by your bonded tokens.
Selecting a group of validators increases your chances of consistently backing at least one who is
active. This results in your bonded tokens being allocated to validators more often, which means
more network security and more rewards. This is in strong contrast to other staking systems that
only allow you to back one validator; if that validator is not active, you as a staker will also not
be. Kusama&#x27;s nomination model solves this.</p><p>Kusama uses tools ranging from election
theory to game theory to discrete optimization, to develop an efficient validator selection process
that offers fair representation and security, thus avoiding uneven power and influence among
validators. The election algorithms used by

increasing their chance of being selected by the election algorithm for block production during a
specific <strong>era</strong>. An era is a period of 6 hours
during which an <strong>active set</strong> of validators is producing blocks and performing other actions on the
chain. This means that not all validators are in the active set and such set changes between eras.
Each era is divided into 6 epochs or <strong>sessions</strong> during which validators are assigned as block
producers to specific time frames or <strong>slots</strong>. This means that validators know the slots when they
will be required to produce a block within a specific session, but they do not know all the slots
within a specific era. Having sessions adds a layer of security because it decreases the chance of
having multiple validators assigned to a slot colluding to harm the network.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="staking-rewards">Staking Rewards<a href="#staking-rewards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Staking Rewards" title="Direct link to Staking Rewards">â€‹</a></h3><p>Validators who produce a block are rewarded with tokens, and they can share rewards with their
nominators. Both validators and nominators can stake their tokens on chain and receive staking
rewards at the end of each era. The staking system pays out rewards equally to all validators
regardless of stake. Thus, having more stake in a validator does not influence the amount of block
rewards it receives. This avoids the centralization of power to a few validators. There is a
probabilistic component in the calculation of rewards, so they may not be exactly equal for all
validators. In fact, during each era validators can earn <strong>era points</strong> by doing different tasks on
chain. The more the points, the higher the reward for a specific era. This promotes validators&#x27;
activity on chain. To know more about era points, and how and on which basis they are distributed
visit the <a href="/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout">dedicated page</a>. Distribution of the
rewards is pro-rata to all stakers after the validator&#x27;s commission is deducted.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="skin-in-the-game-when-staking">Skin in the game when Staking<a href="#skin-in-the-game-when-staking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Skin in the game when Staking" title="Direct link to Skin in the game when Staking">â€‹</a></h3><p>The security of PoS networks depends on the amount of staked tokens. To successfully attack the
network, a malicious actor would need to accrue a large number of tokens or would need different
participants to collude and act maliciously. If there is an attack in the case of NPoS, both the
validator(s) and nominators will be slashed resulting in their stake being partially or fully
confiscated by the network and then deposited to the treasury. There is little interest for a
rational network participant to act in a harmful way because NPoS ensures that all participants can
be held accountable for their bad actions. In NPoS, validators are paid equal rewards regardless of
the amount of stake backing them, thus avoiding large payouts to few large validators which might
lead to centralization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="being-a-nominator">Being a Nominator<a href="#being-a-nominator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Being a Nominator" title="Direct link to Being a Nominator">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tasks-and-responsibilities-of-a-nominator">Tasks and Responsibilities of a Nominator<a href="#tasks-and-responsibilities-of-a-nominator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tasks and Responsibilities of a Nominator" title="Direct link to Tasks and Responsibilities of a Nominator">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>Validators.</strong> Since validator slots are limited, most of those who wish to stake their

risk preferences. Ideally one aims to maximize the reward-to-risk ratio by maximizing rewards and
minimizing risks, with sometimes having to compromise between the two, as minimizing risks might
decrease rewards as well. Nominators should pay attention, especially to six criteria when
nominating validators (not in order of importance):</p><ul><li>recent history of the era points earned across eras</li><li>validator&#x27;s self stake (shows skin in the game)</li><li>total stake backing the validator (which is the sum of self stake and the stake coming from

will pay out more rewards per staked KSM),</li><li>have high own stake (because if slashed they have something to lose),</li><li>have low commission fees but not 0% (because it makes sense that for doing the heavy lifting,
validators ask for a small commission),</li><li>have on-chain registered identity (because it adds a layer of trust and possibly provides access
to their website and contact details),</li><li>and have not been slashed (meaning that their on-chain behavior is genuine).</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-providers">Network Providers<a href="#network-providers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Network Providers" title="Direct link to Network Providers">â€‹</a></h4><p>For successful operation, a Validator node should always be ensured to meet the required
<a href="/maintain/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#reference-hardware">software, hardware, and network bandwidth specifications</a>.
Understandably, most of the validator nodes run on cloud service providers that guarantee high
hardware specifications and high levels of availability and connectivity. Keep in mind that a
validator in the active set is supposed to be fully online and available for producing blocks. If
the active validator node goes offline due to network interruptions or a power outage, that
validator might be subject to
<a href="/docs/learn-staking-advanced#unresponsiveness">slashing due to unresponsiveness</a>. As
<a href="/docs/learn-consensus#block-production-babe">Polkadot&#x27;s block production mechanism</a> is reasonably
resilient to a small proportion of validators going offline, no slashing is imposed until 10% of the
validators in the active set go offline. Hence, if multiple nodes are running on a single cloud
service provider and go offline simultaneously due to an outage or due to a change in their terms
and conditions policy regarding the support of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) operations, the offline
validators and all the nominators backing them can be slashed up 7% of their stake on Polkadot.
Hence, it is recommended that you check if you are nominating the validator nodes that are running
on cloud service providers, and if they do, check if they allow for Proof-of-Stake operations.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Checking Validators using Network Providers</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>You can connect your stash account to the <a href="https://polkawatch.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkawatch app</a>.

following the theory might not necessarily lead to the desired result. Validators might have the
total stake backing them below average, low commission and above average era points in one era and
then have a different profile in the next one. Selection based the criteria like on-chain identity,
slash history and low commission make the staking rewards deterministic. But some criteria vary more
than others, with era points being the most variable and thus one of the key probabilistic
components of staking rewards. Part of this probability is directly related to the fact that a
validator can produce blocks for a parachain (i.e. para-validators) or the relay chain, with
para-validators earning more era points per unit time (see
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout#era-points">this</a> page for more information). The
role can switch between sessions, and you can look at
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the staking tab on the Polkadot-JS UI</a> to know which
validator is producing blocks for the relay chain or parachains.</p><p>It is not recommended to change nominations because of the low era points of a validator in a single
era. Variability in rewards due to the era points should level out over time. If a validator
consistently gets era points below average, it makes sense to nominate a better-performing validator
for the health of the network and increased staking rewards. See

simply paying out from the Treasury. This would be useful in situations such as faulty slashes. In
the case of legitimate slashing, it moves tokens away from malicious validators to those building
the ecosystem through the normal Treasury process.</p><p>Validators with a larger total stake backing them will get slashed more harshly than less popular
ones, so we encourage nominators to shift their nominations to less popular validators to reduce
their possible losses.</p><p>It is important to realize that slashing only occurs for active validations for a given nominator,
and slashes are not mitigated by having other inactive or waiting nominations. They are also not
mitigated by the validator operator running separate validators; each validator is considered its
own entity for purposes of slashing, just as they are for staking rewards.</p><p>In rare instances, a nominator may be actively nominating several validators in a single era. In
this case, the slash is proportionate to the amount staked to that specific validator. With very
large bonds, such as parachain liquid staking accounts, a nominator has multiple active nominations
per era (Acala&#x27;s LDOT nominator typically has 7-12 active nominations per era). Note that you cannot
control the percentage of stake you have allocated to each validator or choose who your active
validator will be (except in the trivial case of nominating a single validator). Staking allocations
are controlled by the <a href="/docs/learn-phragmen">PhragmÃ©n algorithm</a>.</p><p>Once a validator gets slashed, it goes into the state as an &quot;unapplied slash&quot;. You can check this
via
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/staking/slashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot-JS UI</a>.
The UI shows it per validator and then all the affected nominators along with the amounts. While
unapplied, a governance proposal can be made to reverse it during this period
(<!-- -->
days). After the grace period, the slashes are applied.</p><p>The following levels of offense are
<a href="https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/slashing/amounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined</a>. However, these
particular levels are not implemented or referred to in the code or in the system; they are meant as
guidelines for different levels of severity for offenses. To understand how slash amounts are
calculated, see the equations in the section below.</p><ul><li>Level 1: isolated <a href="/docs/learn-staking-advanced/#unresponsiveness">unresponsiveness</a>, i.e. being
offline for an entire session. Generally no slashing, only <a href="#chilling">chilling</a>.</li><li>Level 2: concurrent unresponsiveness or isolated
<a href="/docs/learn-staking-advanced/#equivocation">equivocation</a>, slashes a very small amount of the
stake and chills.</li><li>Level 3: misconducts unlikely to be accidental, but which do not harm the network&#x27;s security to
any large extent. Examples include concurrent equivocation or isolated cases of unjustified voting
in <a href="/docs/learn-consensus">GRANDPA</a>. Slashes a moderately small amount of the stake and chills.</li><li>Level 4: misconduct that poses serious security or monetary risk to the system, or mass collusion.
Slashes all or most of the stake behind the validator and chills.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more details about slashing, please look at our
<a href="https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/slashing/amounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research page</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chilling">Chilling<a href="#chilling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chilling" title="Direct link to Chilling">â€‹</a></h3><p>Chilling is the act of stepping back from any nominating or validating. It can be done by a
validator or nominator at any time, taking effect in the next era. It can also specifically mean
removing a validator from the active validator set by another validator, disqualifying them from the
set of electable candidates in the next NPoS cycle.</p><p>Chilling may be voluntary and validator-initiated, e.g. if there is a planned outage in the
validator&#x27;s surroundings or hosting provider, and the validator wants to exit to protect themselves
against slashing. When voluntary, chilling will keep the validator active in the current session,
but will move them to the inactive set in the next. The validator will not lose their nominators.</p><p>When used as part of a punishment (initiated externally), being chilled carries an implied penalty
of being un-nominated. It also disables the validator for the remainder of the current era and
removes the offending validator from the next election.</p><p>Kusama allows some validators to be
disabled, but if the number of disabled validators gets too large,
Kusama will trigger a new validator election
to get a full set. Disabled validators will need to resubmit their intention to validate and
re-garner support from nominators.</p><p>For more on chilling, see the &quot;<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-chill">How to Chill</a>&quot; page on

staking rate is lower than the ideal staking rate, the annual nominal return rate will be higher,
encouraging more users to use their tokens for staking. On the contrary, when the system staking
rate is higher than the ideal staking rate, the annual nominal return will be less, encouraging some

action. Nominators need to monitor their nominations and ensure they are eligible to receive staking
rewards. Otherwise, they would be risking their funds to secure the chain with no reward. If you are
bonding significantly more than the Minimum Active Bond and yet not receiving rewards, your
nominations are all waiting, or your active validator has 100% commission. However, if you bond
funds close to the Minimum Active Bond, there could be several possibilities for not receiving
staking rewards. The table below can be used to troubleshoot why you might not be receiving staking
