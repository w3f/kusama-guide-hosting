Kusama. They are designed to
permissionlessly allow members to pool their funds together and act as a single nominator account.</p><p>Due to the current runtime constraints,
Kusama can only handle
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
nominators comfortably in the <a href="/docs/learn-nominator#staking-election-stages">electing set</a>. As one of
the objectives of the <a href="/docs/learn-phragmen">NPoS algorithm</a> is to maximize the overall stake on the
network, it can be inferred that the staking system on
Kusama favors nominators with a larger
stake. Only the nominator accounts which back the validators in the active set are eligible for
receiving staking rewards. This leaves out nomination intents from the accounts with lower token
balance than the min-active nomination and places them in a waiting queue to enter electing set.
Nomination pools will be handy for members who want to participate in the staking system with a
stake much lower than the dynamic min-active nomination threshold on the network. All operations are
constant space and time complexity relative to the number of members, eliminating any theoretical
upper bound on the number of members the system can handle and thus scaling the number of accounts
that can participate and earn rewards in the staking system on
Kusama. In summary, each nomination pool is
viewed as a single nominator from the NPoS system point of view.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Why aren&#x27;t the members in the nomination pools called delegators?</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>The term <code>delegator</code> is associated too much with Delegated Proof of Staking (DPoS), and since

In that case, the slash
is distributed evenly across the bonded pool, and the unbonding pools from slash era+1 through the
slash apply era. Thus, any member who either a) was unbonding or b) was actively bonded in the
aforementioned range of eras will be affected by the slash. In other words, a member who may have
been actively bonded during the offence is slashed pro rata based on its stake relative to the total
slash amount.</p><p>Unbonding pools need to be slashed to ensure all nominators who were in the bonded pool while it was
backing a validator that committed an offense are punished. Without these measures a nominator could
unbond right after a validator equivocated with no consequences.</p><p>This strategy is unfair to members who joined after the slash because they get slashed as well, but
it spares members who unbond. The latter is much more important for security: if a pool&#x27;s validators
attack the network, their members need to unbond fast! Avoiding additional slashes gives them an
incentive to do that if validators get repeatedly slashed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nominating-vs-joining-a-pool">Nominating vs Joining a Pool<a href="#nominating-vs-joining-a-pool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Nominating vs Joining a Pool" title="Direct link to Nominating vs Joining a Pool">â€‹</a></h2><p>Nominating is the action of choosing validators. It does not simply involve bonding tokens.
Nominating is an active task, which implies that you regularly monitor that your stake is backing an
active validator in all the eras and check if you are receiving your staking rewards. More
importantly, ensure that the validators you chose always act in the best interests of the network
protocol and have less chance of getting slashed. To nominate, you need a minimum of
<!-- -->,
and to receive rewards, you need at least a balance greater than the minimum active bond. Depending
on your validators, if your active validator is oversubscribed, you will earn rewards only if your
stake is within that of the top
<!-- -->
nominators. If the validator misbehaves, It is worth noting that your stake is subject to slashing,
irrespective of whether you are at the top
<!-- -->
nominators or not.</p><p>As the minimum active bond is a dynamic value, it can make your nomination inactive when the
threshold goes above your bonded balance. Hence, to be eligible to earn rewards while nominating,
you would need to stake a much higher balance than the minimum active bond.</p><p>Nomination pools are a way to participate in staking with as little as 1 DOT and earn staking
rewards. Nomination pools differ from custodial solutions (like staking through central exchanges)
because they are non-custodial, native to Polkadot&#x27;s protocol, permissionless, transparent, and run
in a decentralized way by the community. Before joining a nomination pool, you must ensure that the
pool is earning rewards and nominating the validators that match your preferences. Participating in
pools is more of a set-and-forget action than nominating by yourself. The pool operator maintains
the list of validators nominated by the pool, and so, in a way, you are trusting the pool operator
to act in your best interests. However, it is advised to check the validators nominated by the pool
from time to time and change the pool if necessary.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Minimum Active Nomination Value is Dynamic</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>The minimum amount required to become an active nominator and earn rewards is
